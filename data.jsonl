Is it safe to say we live in a society that places great value on independence, private property, personal space, and privacy? Even sometimes extreme value? Is that why people at an 8-unit apartment building in Oakland, CA have separate caged stalls for eight separate trash cans? I know it’s not nice to stare, but I walked by these incarcerated cans and could not help myself.

Or, at the very least, why can’t the cans share driveway space?\nThe Zero Waste Movement has come to the Bay Area and it calls for a new use for these eight cages. Here are my suggestions:\n- Turn two of those cages into compost bins. Fill one with grass, leaves, and vegetable scraps, let it decompose for six months, then start filling the second bin in the meantime.\n- Put in a green can, which is what Oakland uses to collect milk cartons, pizza boxes, yard trimmings, and all food to send it to the municipal composting facility. If your city doesn’t do this yet, tell them it’s a great idea and they could be as cool and cutting edge as Oakland.\n- Put in one or two recycling cans for glass, plastic, cardboard, paper, aluminum, etc.\n- Put out a FREE STUFF box for unwanted clothing and household items. The neighbors could sort through it each week, and later put it out on the curb for passers-by to explore. Take what’s left to Goodwill or a comparable donation spot.\n- Put in a few small bins for various items that can be recycled, such asbatteries and electronics, which can then be taken to an electronics recycling center every month or two. Styrofoam can be brought to a local packaging store or ceramics business that accepts used packaging material. Or, if you accumulate a bunch of plastic bags,take them to a store or to some other place that accepts used ones.\n- Put in ONE trash can. By the time you compost, recycle, re-use, redistribute, and take a few other measures to reduce your waste, you’ll have almost no trash each week.\n- Install a bicycle rack or locked bicycle cage.\n- With the leftover space, put in a container garden and a bench where neighbors can gather and chat.

{"doc": {"text": "ORLANDO, Fla. — While the Rapid Recall Exchange, the 2-year-old industry recall portal, has signed up more than 600 manufacturer and retailer subscribers, it still lacks the “critical mass” of suppliers that would make it a primary source of recall information, according to trade association officials and retailers.\nManufacturers use the exchange to communicate timely and accurate product recall and withdrawal notifications to retailer and wholesaler headquarters, which in turn share the information with individual stores. The exchange's retail membership represents 85% of U.S. grocery volume — including 21 of the 24 largest supermarket chains based in the United States — but it still lacks key suppliers, especially in the fresh food sectors, said Pat Walsh, senior vice president, industry relations, education and research for Food Marketing Institute, Arlington, Va.\n“We have good penetration [among manufacturers] on the dry grocery side — though it needs to be better — and need to expand in other fresh food verticals like meat, produce, deli and bakery,” said Walsh, who participated in a session on the RRE at the U Connect Live conference here earlier this month.\nMajor food distributors in the exchange, including Kroger, Wegmans and Wakefern, have recently sent letters to their vendors explaining that the only way they will accept recall information is via the RRE, noted Brian Lynch, senior director of business and industry development for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, Washington, who also participated in the U Connect Live session. In an April letter posted on www.rapidrecallexchange.org, Kroger asked all of its suppliers to subscribe to the exchange by July 1.\nMichael Roberson, director of corporate quality assurance for Publix Super Markets, Lakeland, Fla., said in the U Connect Live session that the chain is “disappointed” in the number of manufacturers using the Rapid Recall Exchange.\n“Only 222 of our grocery suppliers are signed up, and more than 1,000 have not yet joined,” Roberson said. “We need to have the entire food industry collaborating on the Rapid Recall Exchange.”\nLast year, of the 300 recalls Publix experienced, fewer than 50 went through the RRE, he said, adding that industrywide only 15% of recalls were submitted to the RRE. A total of 65 recalls have been issued through the exchange industrywide since its September 2009 launch.\nFor recalls that went through the RRE at Publix, Roberson observed “the absolute excellence in the information that was communicated,” including product GTINs (global trade identification numbers), the reason for the recall, and photos. “If we get this information from our trading partners using RRE, then we eliminate most of the [internal] steps because everything works together through this tool,” he said. By contrast, for recalls that don't go through the RRE, “nine times out of 10 we're going back to trading partners and seeking out additional information.”\nPublix has been proactive in urging manufacturers to join the exchange, Roberson said.

Bowman’s strong performance helped the Vikings finish second at the Brissman-Lundeen Invitational at Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois on Saturday, September 24. It was an impressive second place finish for head coach Paul Olsen’s crew as they beat four nationally ranked teams.\nAugustana, ranked sixth in the latest U.S. Track & Field/Cross Country Coaches Association Division III Mideast Regional poll, was one of three teams ranked in the top 10 to compete at the meet. Wisconsin-Stevens Point, ranked fifth, took the team title with 23 points. Augustana finished second with 55 points while Wisconsin-Whitewater, the seventh ranked team in regional poll, placed third with 88 points. Olivet Nazarene took fourth (138), Truman State was fifth (150) and Greenville placed sixth (263).\nThe field also included a couple of ranked teams in the Division III Central Regional poll. Cornell College, ranked ninth, finished tenth in the team scores with 307 points. Grinnell, the number one ranked team in the Central region, finished 16th with 415 points.\nBowman led the way for Augustana with with a fourth place finish and a time of 25:10 over the 8,000 meter course.

{"doc": {"text": "A week ago, talk about Nebraska's running game centered on its stable of talented running backs. Now, you have to throw the quarterback into the mix as well. After redshirt freshman Taylor Martinez gashed Western Kentucky for 127 yards and three touchdowns on just seven carries last Saturday, the Huskers' ground attack became even more dangerous that it already was to begin with.\nConsidering NU faces an Idaho defense that gave up 148 rushing yards to I-AA North Dakota last week, Martinez and backs Roy Helu, Rex Burkhead and Dontrayevous Robinson should once again put up some big numbers on the ground this week.\nNU Pass Offense vs UI Pass Defense\nWith Martinez getting the start once again today, it will be interesting to see if he's able to do a little more through the air against a Vandal defense that ranked 116th nationally in pass defense last season. Last week, Martinez completed some nice passes, but he also got away with some risky throws that arguably should have been picked off.\nIdaho held North Dakota to just 122 passing yards and picked off two passes last week, but then again, it was against North Dakota. Nebraska's wide receivers will be some of the biggest the Vandals' secondary will face all season, and there's really no reason why the Huskers can't be a little more aggressive against such a physically inferior defensive backfield.\nUI Rush Offense vs NU Rush Defense\nThe 155 yards and a touchdown Western Kentucky's Bobby Rainey put up against Nebraska last week were definitely reasons for concern, especially considering NU didn't give up that many yards against any of the talented backs it faced all last season. However, the players and coaches have insisted Rainey's big day was more a result of communication and alignment issues on their part and not because they were physically beaten up front.\nThe good news for the Husker defense is that Idaho doesn't present nearly the challenge WKU was in the run game. Sure, they rushed for nearly 150 yards and three touchdowns against UND, but the Vandals still lost four starting offensive linemen from last season, and their pass-first mentality doesn't necessarily do much for the running game either. Also, word is that sophomore Eric Martin will get the start at linebacker over Alonzo Whaley, so NU should be even more physical against the run.\nUI Pass Offense vs NU Pass Defense\nIf there's one area where Nebraska should genuinely be concerned about going into today's game, it's how they're going to handle Idaho's explosive passing attack led by quarterback Nathan Enderle. The Huskers' secondary is considered one of the biggest strengths of the defense, but it certainly wasn't tested much at all last week.\nThat definitely won't be the case today, as there's no doubt that the Vandals will come out slinging the ball all over the place. Enderle and Co. passed for 399 yards and three touchdowns last week, but the passing game definitely wasn't perfect. North Dakota racked up four sacks in the first half alone and also added an interception.\nSpecial Teams, What If's and The X-Factor\nAs usual, Nebraska gets the edge on special teams primarily because of senior kicker/punter Alex Henery and punt returner Niles Paul. Henery didn't really have to do much last week, and Paul came oh-so-close to breaking a couple of punt returns. In addition, kickoff specialist Adi Kunalic and kickoff returner Tim Marlowe did excellent jobs. Kunalic put two kickoffs into the end zone for touchbacks, and Marlowe averaged 34.5 yards per return. Idaho return man Justin Veltung is a threat on kick returns, but Kunalic should be able to make him a non-factor.\nNebraska Will Win If:\nIt continues to dominate in the run game and finds a way to put pressure on Enderle all game. Though Idaho's offensive line weighs in at an average of roughly 340 pounds, Nebraska's defensive line is much faster and more athletic, and it should be able to put some serious heat on Enderle and at least throw him off his rhythm. And if Martinez pulls off another performance like he did last week, then it's pretty much game over right there.\nIdaho Will Win If:\nIt can force Nebraska to pass the ball and create some turnovers while also putting up some points through the air. Enderle is one of the better quarterbacks in the country right now, and if he can get enough time in the pocket to go through his reads he should be able to find some holes in NU's coverage, especially considering the inexperience at linebacker and safety.\nThere's no question that the one element Nebraska has that Idaho doesn't is a natural playmaker like Martinez. What he lacks in experience and his sometimes questionable decision making he more than makes up for with the ability to score every time he takes a snap. Add in Idaho's recent defensive struggles, and Martinez could be in for another highlight reel performance, which will only further separate himself from the rest of the pack as clear cut starter at quarterback.", "id": "<urn:uuid:04e33fa0-23c2-4de1-a4d2-8ecba512086d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://nfldraft.rivals.com/content.asp?CID=1124611", "date": "2013-05-21T10:05:45Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368699881956/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9720595479011536, "token_count": 1048}, "content": [{"line": "A week ago, talk about Nebraska's running game centered on its stable of talented running backs.

{"doc": {"text": "Amazon.com (AMZN) will have a difficult time meeting analyst expectations this quarter given its several significant headwinds. The two most prominent headwinds relate to revenue, namely the imposition of state sales taxes on Amazon e-commerce revenue and the large increase in federal taxes impacting consumer demand. There is another additional key headwind that is rarely discussed in relation to Amazon, but has and will continue to have a significant impact on operating income - the price of gasoline. While it should be no surprise that gasoline impacts shipping costs, this article enables the reader to accurately predict the impact of gasoline price changes on gross margin, operating income and earnings per share.\nWhile Amazon is quite stingy in the investment information it releases to investors (missing are tablet units, impact of sales tax, streaming users, 3P total merchandise value, AWS COGS, etc…), they do let us know their gross and net shipping expenses. Figure 1 charts gross shipping expense as a percentage of e-commerce revenue against average US gasoline prices in the quarter (regular unleaded, average of all formulations and areas). The chart illustrates that shipping expense had increased steadily from about 7.5% of revenue to 8.6% - 8.9% during 2012. This occurred while Amazon was spending billions of capital on tens of new fulfillment centers closer to the customer to reduce shipping expenses. In order to understand this divergence, I dug a little deeper to determine what is driving the much faster than revenue increases in shipping expense even as shipping distances are being reduced.\nFigure 1: Amazon Gross Shipping Cost as a % of E-Commerce Revenue and Average US Gasoline Prices\nThrough regression analysis of Amazon and government data, I built a shipping expense growth model that demonstrates high correlation to two obvious independent variables: The price of gasoline and what Amazon refers to as \"Paid Units Sold\" (Amazon defines \"Paid Units Sold\" as \"physical and digital units sold\" that \"are paid units and do not include units associated with certain acquisitions, rental businesses, web services or advertising businesses, or Amazon gift certificates\"). The Coefficient of Determination (R2) of this regression was a convincing 0.98, displaying that these two variables alone account for the variation in shipping expense growth. As a note, I thought paid unit growth of 1P units only would be a better predictor as not all 3P units are shipped by Amazon, but the total paid units had a better R2, so I stuck with that.\nWhat does the Statistical Analysis Tell Us?\nHere is the key takeaway: Every 2% increase in gasoline price reduces Amazon's overall gross margin by 10 basis points (BPS). At $16 billion in revenue, every 10 bps of margin reduction results in a $16 million reduction in operating income, or about 2.5¢ in earnings per share reduction. While 10 bps may not sound like a lot, 2.5¢ represents 28% of the analysts $0.09 consensus estimate for Q1. So a minor 2% shift up in gasoline costs can shift earnings lower by 28% in Q1.\nLet's look at this in the wider context of future earnings potential. Amazon bulls like to point to 2009 Q4 as a shining example of Amazon profit potential as they achieved 4.0% net margin and $0.85 per share of earnings. They claim that once all of the current investments subside, Amazon will either return to or exceed those peak margin levels on much higher revenue. Here is a dose of reality for the bulls: If gasoline prices per gallon in 2009 Q4 were what it is today, Amazon would have earned a measly $0.02 per share instead of $0.85! That means given today's energy environment Amazon faces nearly 4.0% net margin headwinds from its prior peak performance.\nHas The Fulfillment Center Build Out Strategy Had Any Positive Impact At All?\nThere is one other interesting result of the analysis to note: the model generated an additive constant term of negative 8.8%. That means that with zero unit growth and no gasoline price change, Amazon shipping expense would shrink by 8.8% Y/Y. This is the positive impact of the distributed fulfillment center strategy and is already baked into the current numbers - you just can't see it in Amazon's financial results due to higher gasoline prices and much higher unit shipments than revenue growth over the past four years. The end result is that although Amazon management recognized they need to do something to stem these two major headwinds, they have only lost ground. While they have increased fulfillment expense as a percentage of revenue by 270 bps, shipping expense has increased 120 bps as a percentage of revenue, thus reducing net margin by 400 bps over the past four years. Based on these trends it seems Amazon will need to continue to invest heavily in fulfillment expenses over the next several years just to return to 2009 shipping expense percentage levels of e-commerce revenue.\nIs There Hope For Gasoline Prices to Return to 2009 Levels?\nThis is highly unlikely as the global financial crisis scared the energy markets into a severe dip (60% drop) at the end of 2008/early 2009. Gasoline prices have begun an exponential run up over the past few weeks and have well surpassed both the prior quarter and year ago quarter's level seven weeks into the quarter (Figure 2). Oil prices tend to lead gasoline prices by 4 to 6 weeks, so look for gasoline prices to continue to rise significantly into the end of Q1 to near all-time high levels ($4.11/gal) as oil continues to print new 9-month highs. That could mean all time high shipping expense as a percentage of e-commerce revenue for Amazon in Q2. The current White House Administration's tough policy approach on fossil fuels coupled with the Fed's QE infinity program should continue to pressure oil prices higher through at least 2015, leading me to wonder why Amazon is considered a \"risk-on\" trade with its strong inverse earnings sensitivity to oil prices. Not only does an increase in gasoline cost increase Amazon's shipping expense, it also lowers consumer's discretionary income, thus providing an additional headwind to revenue - a true double whammy.\nFigure 2: Weekly US Gasoline Prices for Q/Q and Y/Y Comparisons\nCore to Amazon's value proposition is the convenience of shipping product directly to your door. That service currently reduces operating margin by 870 bps (up from 750 bps three years ago) and is directly correlated to the cost of gasoline. For every 2% increase in gasoline cost, Amazon gross margin declines by 10 bps. This relation has reduced Amazon net margin by 400 bps to zero over the last four years. While spending billions on new distributed fulfillment centers has attempted to reduce the impact of soaring gasoline prices, shipping expenses as a percentage of e-commerce revenue continues to climb as Amazon paid units shipped far outpace revenue growth and gasoline price increases continue to override any Amazon efficiency gains. In the current money printing and political environment, energy costs are skyrocketing, thus having a direct and meaningful impact on Amazon profit potential for 2013 and beyond.\nNote: Additional information on the model, data and analysis can be made available through my consulting practice.\nDisclosure: I am short AMZN.", "id": "<urn:uuid:c6c03e75-ef3c-4e66-80ce-d937222af5e1>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://seekingalpha.com/article/1220891-amazon-is-getting-gassed", "date": "2013-05-21T10:30:21Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368699881956/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9471746683120728, "token_count": 1484}, "content": [{"line": "Amazon.com (AMZN) will have a difficult time meeting analyst expectations this quarter given its several significant headwinds.

The six school districts, New York City Department of Education, Los Angeles Unified School District, Chicago Public Schools, Dallas Independent School District, Miami-Dade County Public Schools and Orange County Public Schools in Orlando, officially formed USFA earlier this year to use their purchasing power to continue to improve food quality for students while driving down costs.\n\"This show of solidarity is unprecedented,\" said Los Angeles Unified School District Food Services Director David Binkle. \"It demonstrates that all the school districts in the alliance can work together to implement the same programs while serving nutritious meals to our students.\"\nThe lunch meal, consisting of savory roasted chicken, brown rice with seasoned black or red beans, steamed green broccoli, fresh seasonal fruit and milk, will be served more than 2.6 million times today in the six districts.\n\"We created this menu based on the most popular items we commonly serve in each of our Districts,\" said Leslie Fowler, Director of Nutrition Support Services at Chicago Public Schools. \"Our goal moving forward is to identify these commonalities and work with our vendors to capitalize on our purchasing power so that we're providing the best and freshest foods possible to our students at the lowest costs possible.\"\nThe Urban School Food Alliance first met in Denver in 2012 and has since kept in communication regularly via telephone. The food services directors from each of the school districts share and review menu items to ensure that they provide access to meals that meet the USDA's nutrient recommendations including whole grain products, low fat dairy, fresh produce and lean protein that when prepared are calorie conscious and low in fat, sugar and sodium. In addition to creating a purchasing powerhouse, the coalition is working to be more ecologically friendly in their respective districts.

The state's special antlerless deer season is just around the corner. Scheduled for Dec. 22-24 and Dec. 29-31, these opportunities allow hunters to harvest does outside their combined season limit.\nAccording to Mike Shaw, wildlife research supervisor for the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, hunters across the state have already harvested 104,346 deer in 2006, surpassing the previous record of 102,100 deer taken in 2000. That total stands to increase with the remainder of archery and special antlerless seasons still to go. Shaw said other factors will raise the numbers as well, such as final counts from controlled hunts and Deer Management Assistance Program cooperators.\nShaw said a number of circumstances have led to the record harvest, such as the good hunting weather and peak rutting times that fell right in line with this year's rifle season.\nBut even with the record numbers, Shaw encourages hunters to participate in the special three-day antlerless hunts.\n\"We need to really focus on increasing the number of antlerless deer harvested, especially in areas that have less desirable buck-to-doe ratios,\" Shaw said. \"And participating in the special antlerless deer season would be an excellent way to do that.\"\nThe first three-day period of the special antlerless season will be limited to the northcentral and northwestern portions of the state, excluding most of the panhandle. The second three-day period will be open for hunting in the same areas as the first part of the season, but also in most of the remainder of the state. The panhandle will again be excluded, as will the far southeastern counties. For a map of Oklahoma's antlerless deer hunt zones and to see which counties will be open for the special season, hunters should refer to page 14 of the \"2006-07 Oklahoma Hunting Guide.\"\nTo participate in the special antlerless deer season, hunters must possess a special antlerless deer gun license as well as an annual hunting license and a fishing and hunting legacy permit. Resident lifetime hunting or combination license holders are exempt from purchasing these licenses.\nIn addition, hunters participating in the special antlerless deer season must comply with the hunter orange requirements set forth for the regular deer gun season. Archery hunters and those hunting most other species in open special antlerless zones must wear either a hunter orange hat or upper garment while hunting.\nTo learn more about this year's special antlerless deer season, refer to the \"2006-07 Oklahoma Hunting Guide\" or log on to www.wildlifedepartment.com.", "id": "<urn:uuid:4b0a1b87-7a7c-423b-8494-7ff2d0f7858a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.biggamehunt.net/news/oklahoma-deer-hunters-hit-record-harvest", "date": "2013-05-26T03:05:39Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368706499548/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516121459-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9446782469749451, "token_count": 572}, "content": [{"line": "Oklahoma Deer Hunters Hit Record Harvest", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Oklahoma deer hunters have already achieved a record harvest for the state in 2006 — 104,000 and counting — but their opportunities to take deer are far from being over.

But we got through the game with no injuries and we got the win.\"\nThey had the win after the first period, in which they outshot Denmark 19-3 and built a 4-0 lead, but there were, unfortunately, two more periods to play, which can best be described as a half-interested cat pawing at a half-dead mouse.\n\"Maybe not our toughest competition,\" understated Ryan Strome. \"But we have to continually strive to be better. None of the games are getting easier from here on in so we have to keep getting better ourselves.\"\nThey'd have to play corpses for the next game to be any easier, but all you can do is play who they put in front of you and the Canadians are 3-0 so far, having beaten Finland 8-1 and the Czech Republic 5-0 for a 23-2 margin of victory so far.\nThree straight blowouts might not be the best way to prepare for the biggest games of their lives, but what can you do?\n\"People can look at it however they want, but we've been tested,\" said Brett Connolly. \"The Finns were a great team, the Czechs gave us a good battle, too. We're a good team.\"\nAfter scoring more goals in the first (four) than Denmark had shots (three), Canada eased up in the second but still managed to score its fifth, sixth and seventh goals of the night.\nAnd that was it, the other team was Dane like dinner.\n\"It was a tough one for Denmark, coming up from the B pool,\" said winger Boone Jenner. \"But we just tried to keep playing our game, just play simple hockey.\"\n\"It's not like we were trying to run up the score,\" added forward Brendan Gallagher. \"We've been on the other side of those, all of us have, and it's not a good feeling.\"\nThe Canadians spent the third period trying not to get injured and that was all the opening Denmark needed to strike back. Nicolai Meyer sniped one past Mark Visentin to break the shutout and eight minutes later Emil Kristensen added a second Danish goal.\nAt that point, Canada got serious again and scored its eighth and ninth and 10th.\n\"We knew on the bench that we had to get back to work,\" said Gallagher. \"We were a little sluggish and they took advantage of us. They didn't stop working for the whole game. We just went back to the things that made us successful and were able to score some more goals.\"\nSo the Canadians are 3-0 so far, with one game left in the round robin -- a New Year's Eve date with the Americans that could either be for first place in the pool, or rendered entirely meaningless if the U.S. loses to the Czech Republic on Friday.\n\"We'll be ready to roll on New Year's Eve,\" said Jenner. \"It should be a fun game to play in, and a competitive one.\"\nFor a change.", "id": "<urn:uuid:420fbd96-f522-489c-bff9-429c76a641d3>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/sports/archives/2011/12/20111230-020931.html", "date": "2013-05-26T03:05:07Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368706499548/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516121459-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9856277108192444, "token_count": 815}, "content": [{"line": "Hockey fans cheer on Team Canada during their game against Team Denmark during World Juniors hockey action at Rexall Place in Edmonton Alberta, Thursday Dec. 29, 2011.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Credits: DAVID BLOOM/EDMONTON SUN/QMI AGENCY", "label": "Legal and Administrative Content", "split": false}, {"line": "EDMONTON -- In a game that had moths versus windshield written all over it, there wasn't enough wiper fluid in all of Edmonton to clean off the goo.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "But despite all the guts, there wasn't much glory to be found for Team Canada in crushing hopelessly overmatched Denmark 10-2 at the world junior championship Thursday.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "This was lambs being lead to slaughter and the Canadians simply went about their business with the cold and ruthless efficiency of an executioner.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\"It's a hard game to play in when you're expected to win and expected to score a lot of goals,\" said head coach Don Hay. \"It's not easy to do.

{"doc": {"text": "It’s Time to Panic — The Great Chicken Wing Shortage May Wreak Havoc with Your Super Bowl Plans\nOkay, America. We have some news that will profoundly affect how you watch the Super Bowl. Brace yourself.\nNo, scientists still haven’t figured out a way to teleport you there under the cloak of invisibility, so you still need a ticket.\nIt turns out a shortage of chicken wings may be on the horizon\nWhat the cluck is that about? That’s like playing a Super Bowl without a football.\nBefore you go loco, keep in mind the very fake-sounding, but very much real National Chicken Council chimed in to explain the reason behind this biggest national disaster not involving the name Manti Te’o. And while the economics behind it are more convoluted than the 49ers defensive scheme, it comes down to this:\n“Demand for wings this year is at ‘an all-time high’ due to decreased wing production caused by the high cost of corn and feed prices. Wings are currently the highest priced portion of a chicken and cost $2.11 a pound in the Northeast, up 12 percent from last year.”\nThe council says 1.23 billion wing segments – they don’t sound as tasty when called “segments” do they? — will be wolfed down during this year’s big game, about 12.3 fewer than we gobbled up last year when the New York Giants managed to wipe the smirk off Bill Belichick’s face.\nShort of Beyoncé deciding to lip sync (again!) during halftime, this may be the most scandalous thing to hit this year’s game. The Super Bowl is the second biggest day for food during the year, trailing only Thanksgiving, and wings are the most consumed item on this most sacred of Sundays.\nA spokesman for the National Chicken Council did manage to alleviate everyone’s worst fear, though, by saying wings will be available. He added that although they may cost a bit more, “The good news for consumers is that restaurants plan well in advance to ensure they have plenty of wings for the big game.” Phew. Bullet dodged.\nGood to know because without wings, we’d be left only to eat pizza. And sliders. And Doritos. And M&Ms. And pigs in a blanket. And fried chicken. And subs. And pretzels.\nAnd heaven knows that’s just not enough selection for all the artery-clogged football fans out there.", "id": "<urn:uuid:8d6f8d90-4567-4181-af0e-5e3351fb33fc>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blakefm.com/its-time-to-panic-the-great-chicken-wing-shortage-may-wreak-havoc-with-your-super-bowl-plans/", "date": "2013-05-18T17:38:17Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696382584/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092622-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9344670176506042, "token_count": 538}, "content": [{"line": "It’s Time to Panic — The Great Chicken Wing Shortage May Wreak Havoc with Your Super Bowl Plans", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Okay, America.

{"doc": {"text": "Geotags, aerial synths, street synths… capturing events as they happen. If you can mark it on a map, then this is the place to talk about it.\nThere are some really cool places in the world that I'd love to see synths of, but for lack of time and money haven't been able to make it to (yet). Here's my list. What about other people, what would you like to see?\n• Shiptons Arch, China\n• Angel Falls, Venezuela\n• Nazca lines, Peru\n• Bungle Bungles, Australia\n• some bones in dinosaur national monument, Colorado/Utah\n• Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe/Zambia\n• K2/Baltoro Glacier, Pakistan http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&FORM=LMLTCP&cp=35.759607~76.548615&style=h&lvl=11&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&cam=-54.055532~-37.330167&scene=-1&phx=0&phy=0&phscl=1&encType=1\n• Deer Cave, Malaysia\nThe Ice Hotel!\n[Insert large cavern system here] preferably shot both as a walk-through (and back!) but also as panoramics in areas of interest so we get lots of donuts.\nAnother one high on my list would be an aerial synth of the Grand Canyon, preferably done about 200' below the altitude of the rim so you're down in it the whole way. Ideally, photograph it using a hemispherical array of cameras all synchronized to a single shutter control so you get instant donuts every time an exposure is taken.\nBut you know what would be tops on my list? For the Mars rover teams to submit their pictures as massive synths. MWAHAHAHAHAHAA! I'd love to boldly go where no man has gone before. Ok, so little wheeled robots have, but...\nI realize I'm posting things that aren't likely to be picked up by someone local to the place who says, \"Sure! That's easy enough!\" but these really are the places I'd love to see synthed.\nHow about New Zealand. Not exciting? I'm talking about someone Synth'ing their Bungie trip from the walk up, to the jump off, the way down, and the bounce back up.\nThat camera had better be strapped onto their helmet...\nFracture - this thread was meant to be list of all the places in the world we'd like to see a synth of where we currently don't have one. We actually have OK coverage of NZ, but havent seen any taken while bungie jumping. That would be fairly cool, skydiving as well.\nCan you guys think of any more places/situtation we need synths of?\nSon Doong Cave In Vietnam\nWhile I was replying to a thread about collaborative synths, this came to mind:\nI know Photosynth won't synth water, but a closer statement would be that it won't synth the water's surface. Underwater there are loads of fixed points to tie images together. Soooo...\nI'd love to see a synth of a coral reef. That would be a BLAST.\nEven better, I'd love to figure out a way to tie the below-water images to the above-water shots and have someone on the reef and someone else on shore doing a collaborative synth. You'd be able to \"stand on the beach\" at the beginning of the synth, and \"dive underwater\" to see the reef.\n(Oh PLEEEEZE tell me someone is interested in doing this! I don't have an underwater housing on my camera!!)\nI think Tom's onto something here. I think the transition from above water to below water would be the absolute hardest part, but I too would LOVE to see this.\nA good polarizer and a really careful choice of angles might work. I've had underwater features show up in a couple of synths I've done this way. It might be enough to tie the two, though the other direction would be a LOT harder.\n(Anyone on the Big Island with an underwater housing for their camera? I'll do the dry-land photography!)\nCave systems in halong bay/Cat Ba island Vietnam would fit your suggestion TBenedict, and I'd love to see them\nhttp://images.google.com/images?q=halong bay cave system&rls=com.microsoft:en-gb:IE-SearchBox&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=ie7&rlz=1I7HPEA_en&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi\nAlso synths of reefs.. excellent idea. There are a huge team of underwater photographers in Egypt and some awesome dive sites I'm sure the Devs here could fire off some emails to camel divers & they could use it for promo work ;) ;) One possiblility would be the use of a glass bottom boat to ease the transition from land to water?\nI'd particularly like to see some underwater wrecks, starting underwater at the boat near a shallow reef and descending down. Some well phrased emails would definately start off a few clusters of this type of synth!\nAny series of photos from space... The saturn mission has some good stuff going around Titan - their pictures are already in the public domain as well, I reckon they might be up for some synthing..\nI honestly think you're right, the above/below beach/reef synth should ideally be done by underwater photographers.\nI REALLY like the idea of the glass bottomed boat for the transition. That or something similar on a smaller scale.\nI'm still interested in doing this, but I hope an honest to goodness underwater photographer beats me to it. It will be far better done.\nYour mention of space synths (of which I think NASA has done several) gave me an idea... I'll try to get this one done later in the week (time permitting.)\nOkay, I'm now obsessed with large scale underwater reef synthing... Underwater photography is tough, normally holiday divers don't have the equipment to balance the red shift (deeper water has less blue light) it's a pain to have to add/remove coloured slides for every photo.. (sorry--going off topic there)\nI emailed one dive centre in Sharm el Sheik but they haven't responded so I have sent emails out to dive centres I have worked at in the past suggesting they make a synth map a part of their dive master/master scuba diver course or make a synth to use for promos, there are centres where professionals dive the same reefs month in month out, 20 photos per dive, 70 dives per month... Anyways, I'll let you know if I get any success synth fishing :D\nAlso, to return to the thread topic - I'd love to see a synth from the front of a train, some rapid fire photos might do the trick from trains both ways?\n*deeper water has less red light... doh!\nGlad to see you taking point on this, Mister_Blondie! I don't even qualify as a holiday diver, and my equipment is nil. I really like the direction you're taking with that, especially the idea of using photos from centers where professionals are in there all the time. I'd really like to see how that turns out!\nI don't know about the front of a train, but a while back Darius posted a link to a \"drive through\" synth where someone was taking pictures from inside a car, coming and going. The technique works quite well. At the speeds most trains go, though, you might need a pretty high frame rate to pull that off. Glad you thought of doing it both ways. For the viewer to be able to turn around and go back, that's essential.\nNo dice on the space synth I hoped to do this week. I'll have another chance next week, so I'll give it another go then.\nA sculpture park. A whole big sculpture park...\nHere's an fantastic attempt at a sculpture park: http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=97153326-97b4-4df7-ba8d-aaf9851fa34d\nThis is pushing the upper limit of the synther as it is, so a park larger than this would be very difficult. The overhead view in this one is great.\nawesome, thanks :)\nI'd like to see some Mt Everest base camp synths.\nThis takes a step out of the realm of the real world, but I'd absolutely love to see Michael Chesko's miniature model cities thoroughly synthed.\nHe's worked on models of New York City, but also has a fictional city of his own design, entitled 'Britannica'. I happened to bump into his work on Robyn Miller's blog some time ago and have been hooked on the idea of synthing his models ever since.\nYou can find one of Robyn's Britannica posts here: http://tinselman.typepad.com/tinselman/2008/08/stop-and-smell.html\nUnfreakin'real. I second that, Nathanael. I'd be willing to be there are no small number of photographers who would be ready to jump at the chance. (I WOULD!)\nI would love to synth Jack Lewis's house, \"The Kilns\".\nShort of being able to tackle it myself, though, I'd truly enjoy someone else doing a good job of it.", "id": "<urn:uuid:aa71c29b-fc84-4974-ab2d-24a501adf539>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://photosynth.net/discussion.aspx?cat=a03647b9-821e-439b-8dbc-ae0239d6870d&dis=af7481c3-563f-44ee-8c43-034792821894", "date": "2013-05-24T01:37:21Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368704132298/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516113532-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9325752258300781, "token_count": 2037}, "content": [{"line": "Geotags, aerial synths, street synths… capturing events as they happen.

{"doc": {"text": "HOULTON, Maine — A compliance check recently conducted in Aroostook County to ensure that businesses that sell alcohol are complying with Maine’s liquor laws produced disappointing news, as nearly half of the establishments targeted were cited by police.\nDeputy Kris Malmbourg of the Aroostook County Sheriff’s Department said earlier this week that 33 establishments, including restaurants and stores, around The County were checked for liquor law compliance as part of the Underage Drinking, Adult Consequences campaign. Of those, 13 were summoned for violations.\nAroostook County was selected last month as one of only four sites in the nation to participate in the underage drinking project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nCommunity Voices, a countywide organization that works to curb substance abuse among youths, was awarded a $325,000 grant, which it is using to work with 11 law enforcement groups on a pilot project to get alcohol out of the hands of minors.\nMalmbourg said the most recent compliance checks were part of the initiative and are being conducted to reduce the number of underage drinkers and the number of underage drinking and driving fatalities in The County. They also are being conducted to deter those who provide alcohol to youths.\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, teens are at far greater risk of death in an alcohol-related crash than the overall population, despite the fact that they are below the minimum drinking age in every state. Thirty one percent of 15- to 20-year-old drivers who were killed in crashes nationally in 2006 had been drinking.\nAccording to Maine’s office of substance abuse, a 2008 statewide survey reported that 48.8 percent of Maine students in grades seven through 12 had tried alcohol. Research also has shown that 40 percent of children who begin drinking before age 15 will develop alcohol abuse or dependence at some point in their lives.\nMalmbourg pointed out that 142 people died in Maine from 2006 to 2010 as a result of a crash involving a 15- to 20-year-old driver with a blood alcohol content of 0.01 or above. In 2010 alone, 22 percent of 15- to 20-year-old drivers involved in traffic fatalities in Maine had a blood alcohol content of 0.01 or above.\n“One careless decision by a young person can end and destroy lives,” Malmborg said. “We know we have more work to do, but if we got across to just one teen who might have otherwise chosen to drink and drive, we’ve accomplished something and hopefully changed lives. And if we’re able to reduce their access to alcohol, that’s tackling the first part of the problem.”\nAlong with the 13 establishments summoned for noncompliance, the additional road patrols in Aroostook resulted in youth transportation and possession of alcohol citations, as well as citations for adults furnishing a place for minors to consume and alcohol for minors to consume. Other violations not alcohol-related were dealt with as a result of the increased patrols, ranging from driving violations to drug violations, according to Malmbourg.\n“Local enforcement officials and community partners came together for this campaign, and we believe it was a tremendous success,” he said. “Hopefully, the teens in our community now know we will not tolerate underage drinking, and just as importantly, the adults and organizations who provide the alcohol know they also face serious consequences.”\nThis is not the first time that compliance checks have revealed that not all County businesses are enforcing the state’s liquor laws. In March 2011, the Sheriff’s Department oversaw an operation that had minors attempt to buy alcohol at 43 businesses stretching from Macwahoc to Fort Kent.\nTwenty-three of the establishments sold alcohol to the minors and were summoned for the violation, according to Sheriff Jim Madore.\nDuring the summer of 2010 in Caribou, the Police Department selected 12 local businesses where alcohol is served.\nFifty percent of the businesses failed the test and sold the minor alcohol, according to Caribou Chief Mike Gahagan.\nGahagan said at the time that he was stunned by the results, especially since the department offers free responsible beverage training to businesses in the city.\nMichelle Plourde Chasse, Community Voices project manager, said Friday afternoon that she also was disappointed with the results. She noted that compliance checks that were conducted in January revealed an almost 50 percent failure rate. That rate is slightly lower this time.\n“I wish there was a magic button because I would push it,” she said. “We will continue to offer training twice a year to businesses in this area and we are going to continue with compliance checks.”\nThe project manager said she believes that it would be helpful to immediately list the names of businesses that were summoned in order to let parents and others know that they were cited. But the names have not been released in the past until the cases were settled in court, and Plourde Chasse did not have the list of businesses that were cited during this round of checks.\nPenalties for the violations can result in a fine, license suspension or both. Fines for stores start at between $550 and $1,500 for a first violation, depending on the number of offenses.\nThe next wave of compliance checks will start this month and the enforcement campaign will continue throughout the year.", "id": "<urn:uuid:2d4fc080-d435-428d-ac54-a89ca1918f25>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2012/05/04/news/aroostook/13-businesses-in-aroostook-county-fail-liquor-compliance-checks/", "date": "2013-05-26T09:36:48Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368706890813/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516122130-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9792044758796692, "token_count": 1121}, "content": [{"line": "HOULTON, Maine — A compliance check recently conducted in Aroostook County to ensure that businesses that sell alcohol are complying with Maine’s liquor laws produced disappointing news, as nearly half of the establishments targeted were cited by police.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Deputy Kris Malmbourg of the Aroostook County Sheriff’s Department said earlier this week that 33 establishments, including restaurants and stores, around The County were checked for liquor law compliance as part of the Underage Drinking, Adult Consequences campaign.

{"doc": {"text": "|Page (1) of 1 - 07/10/12||email article||print page|\nToday, News Corp. officially announced plans to split into two separate publicly traded companies. One of the companies will focus on News Corp's booming film and television assets, including 20th Century Fox film studio, Fox News Channel, and Fox broadcast news. The other company will include News Corp's publishing assets, such as the Wall Street Journal, The Times of London, and HarperCollins book publishing. The company's publishing assets have struggled recently in the wake of a phone hacking scandal in Great Britain. In News Corp's last quarterly earnings report, entertainment revenues came to $6.2 billion, while publishing assets only brought in $2 billion. Chief Executive Rupert Murodch will serve as chairman of both companies. He will also be CEO for the entertainment-focused company. No word yet on who will serve as CEO on the publishing side, but Murdoch has dismissed fears that the publishing company will not be able to stand on its own. The transaction will take roughly a year to complete. News of the split's possibility caused News Corp shares to rise sharply over the past couple of days.

{"doc": {"text": "From Dr. Mike Mawson:\nWe are pleased to announce a new one-year Master’s in Theological Ethics degree at the University of Aberdeen. Aberdeen’s department of Divinity is currently one of the top-ranked theology programs in the UK, and recent appointments in the areas of Systematic Theology and Theological Ethics have further strengthened the department. The Theological Ethics area emphasizes fundamental texts and thinkers in the Christian tradition for engaging contemporary issues and debates. For more information: http://www.abdn.ac.uk/divinity/pgrad/MThTheologicalEthics.shtml\nIf you have questions or are interested in applying to the MTh program feel free to contact Professor Bernd Wannenwetsch, Dr Brian Brock or Dr Michael Mawson. We will be happy to meet with prospective students at the American Academy of Religion meeting (in Chicago in November 2012) or the Society of Christian Ethics meeting (in Chicago in January 2013).\nIn addition, we would be happy to discuss funding options for prospective Master’s and doctoral students.

Outside of the first 10 minutes of cheesy jokes by Saturday Night Live comedian Andy Samberg, the rest of the talk has seen Zuckerberg painting a picture of a big new overhaul of profiles called ‘Timeline.’\nTimeline was described by Zuckerberg as: “All of your stories, all of your apps, a new way to express who you are.” It will also integrate with mobile, to create a more seamless user experience from mobile to web. Timeline will be progressively rolled out over the next few months, and will initially look quite bare.\nThe new Facebook Timeline will be more visual and include a ‘Cover’, which is one big image to visually \"express who you are\" – which doesn’t replace the profile picture. Users will also be able to be more easily go back into the archive of content and conversations since they joined Facebook. They will receive weekly or yearly Reports, which will give them a summary of events and activities they have done. The Timeline will also enable a user to Highlight an important event, update or piece of content in order to flag it up on their Timeline.\nFacebook have spent the last year working on the Open Graph protocol, which they believe will make it possible to build a completely new ‘social class’ of apps than ever before.\nThe Open Graph will open up to two additional areas. Currently, its communication, and games and will now open up to media (TV, music, movies, news and books) and lifestyle apps (cooking, eat, emotions, fashion, fitness etc.).\nOne announcement that almost got a round of applause from the audience, was that users can be engaged with an app and never have a pop up again to authorize and ask if they want to share it on their news feed again. With the new integration of Timeline and Apps, it will presume that if you want to use an app that you want to publish it on your Timeline, which is what Zuckerberg is calling a \"frictionless experience.\" Developers will be able to implement the 'add to Timeline' button on through Open Graph straight after f8, which will work immediately across all platforms.\nThe ticker feature also enables you to have a \"serendipitous experience\" with friends, particularly when it comes to music. The founder demonstrated how with Open Graph and music social network Spotify, you can listen along with friends; you see in the ticker feed that your friend is listening to Up, the new single by James Morrison you can simply hover over the alert and listen along. This will also be the case with launch partner, iHeartRadio.\nFacebook has also announced the addition of verbs so you will be able to ‘read a book’ or ‘watch a movie.’\nThere's still a whole day of seminars to go at f8, but I'm off to do some knitting and eat dinner.

Hand over the keys.\nWe have a political system that is the equivalent of a drunk driver. The primary culprits are the House Republicans. They are so intoxicated with their own ideology that they are ready to drive the nation's car off the road. I don't know if the sequestration that began Friday will produce a little crisis or a big one; the sad fact is that the Republicans don't know either, yet they're still willing to put the country at risk to make a political point.\nI'm no fan of the way President Obama has handled the fiscal crisis.

In my analogy, he should take the steering wheel firmly in hand and drive the car toward the destination where most road maps show we need to be heading — namely, a balanced program of cuts in Social Security and Medicare and modest increases in revenue.\nInstead, Obama has chosen to be co-dependent, as the psychologists say about those who foster the destructive behavior of others. He double-dared the reckless Republicans by proposing the sequester back in 2011. And rather than stepping up to leadership since his re-election, he has triple-dared the GOP hotheads with a partisan inaugural address and weeks of what the Republicans rightly have called a \"road show\" of blame-game politics. Doesn't he see that the GOP is addicted to this showdown at Thunder Road? This is all the power the GOP has these days, really — the ability to scare the heck out of everybody and run the car into the ditch.\nMuch as I would criticize Obama, it's wrong to say that both sides are equally to blame for what's about to hit us. This isn't a one-off case of the Republicans using Obama's sequestration legislation to force reckless budget cuts. It's a pattern of behavior: First the Republicans were prepared to shut down the government and damage the national credit rating with their showdown over the debt ceiling; then they were careening toward the \"fiscal cliff.\" This isn't a legislative tactic anymore, it's an addiction.\nWhere did this recklessness come from? Only a few years ago, George W. Bush was the compassionate conservative and John McCain won the GOP nomination as the Republican who knew how to govern across party lines. What happened to that Republican Party? Today's Republicans seem to suffer from what's sometimes known as Obama Derangement Syndrome, in which their hatred of the president blinds them to the country's interests. To be honest, this malady is eerily similar to the Bush Derangement Syndrome that afflicted Democrats during the previous decade. The Democrats were so incensed back then they stopped caring if America succeeded or failed in Iraq; the Republicans are so angry now that they don't care if the economy goes to hell.\nSo how can we get these incapacitated drivers to stop before they do any more damage?

{"doc": {"text": "Lake Orion, Mich. – Part of defending champion Olin Browne’s preparation for the 2012 U.S. Senior Open will be competing in the U.S. Open at The Olympic Club. In addition to negotiating Olympic’s ubiquitous slopes and confounding doglegs, Browne hopes to be distracted by following the progress of his son, Olin Jr.\n“O” – as Browne calls his son – is attempting to join his father at a U.S. Open sectional qualifier in Columbus, Ohio, on June 4. Several days before the qualifier, dad still didn’t know whether he would go watch.\n“It’s a difficult position to be in,” said the elder Browne at Senior Open Media Day on May 30. “I don’t want to show up and put that kind of heat on him. On the one hand, it’s nice to support for your kid. Whether I’m there or not, he knows that, I love him and support him and I’m pulling for him to do the very best he can.”\nIf the younger Olin qualifies, the Brownes will be the first father-son duo to play together in the U.S. Open since Jay and Bill Haas achieved the rare feat in 2003 and 2004.\n“It would be unbelievable,” said Browne Sr. “He’s thinking about it; he knows I’m thinking about it. He’s got probably a one in 10 chance of making it. So it’s up to him to prepare himself properly. It’s part of the learning process.”\nIf there is anyone who could impart good advice about sectional qualifying, it would be the elder Browne, who shot 59 at Woodmont Country Club in Rockville, Md., to advance to the 2005 U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina.\nQualifying presents one set of challenges; the championship itself offers others. Despite having the type of controlled game that would seem like a perfect fit for the U.S. Open, Browne’s performance in the championship – one top-10 finish in 11 starts – was less successful. He has fared much better since turning 50, and has yet to finish out of the top 10 in three U.S. Senior Opens, capped by last year’s victory.\nThis delayed success is fitting for the late bloomer, who didn’t pick up the game until he was 19. Browne didn’t play his first U.S. Open until he was 35, but has felt comfortable on golf’s biggest stage.\n“Overall, the USGA setup is fairly consistent, in which every facet of the game is a component of good play” said Browne. “You have to drive the ball well, strike irons consistently, control ball flight, play smart and manage your game well. It’s more of a marathon.”\nAfter getting a glimpse of Indianwood Golf & Country Club, the site of the 2012 U.S. Senior Open, Browne came away with a similar sense of comfort that he possessed last year at Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio.\n“The course is sensational,” said Browne. “I love these kinds of greens that are open in the front.”\nLast year, Browne withheld a charge from Mark O’Meara by playing the final 10 holes in one under. It was the culmination of a journey that began when he was just starting to learn the game at the driving range accompanied by his girlfriend – now wife – and they would daydream about winning the national championship.\n“We’d talk about the U.S. Open,” Browne recalled. “We didn’t talk about the PGA or the Masters or the [British] Open Championship. It was always the last hole of the U.S. Open. That was my reference point.”\nNow that dream has become reality, Browne is relishing his status and basking in the benefits his victory has borne, such as the rare opportunity to potentially share an indelible U.S. Open memory with his son.\n“Here we are, 11 months later, and [the U.S. Senior Open win] still has legs,” said Browne. “It’s a source of great pride and it’s a privilege to be seen as a USGA champion.”\nHunki Yun is a USGA senior staff writer.

{"doc": {"text": "You have to admit, trends are unavoidable. Some are so stealthy, maybe even ubiquitous, that it’s hard to tell if something is considered “classic” or if it’s actually trendy.\nSometimes one piece is a classic over the long term, but comes in and out of popularity throughout the years, taking it from something standard to something really trendy and eventually back again.\nOne of the more recent examples I can think of is the Sperry Top-Sider… a shoe which has resurged in popularity over the past several years, but was actually invented back in the 30s for the sole (pun intended, kinda) purpose of making it safe to run around on a boat deck.\nAccording to some, Top-Siders first gained popularity as an everyday “fashionable” shoe choice in the 80s. Soo… trendy or classic?\nDepends on who you ask, I guess. I say classic, considering its history… but if you ask a 14-year-old who first learns of boat shoes at Urban Outfitters, he might consider it trendy.\nCould it be both?\nAnyway, all of this just to say that it doesn’t really matter. Some things are trendy, some are classic, some are classic that become trendy and go back to being regular ol’ classics again.\nWear what you like\nOne thing I always tell people who are still figuring out their personal style: Wear what you like. Who cares what other people think, seriously. We’re not in 6th grade anymore. You should wear what you love and what makes you feel good.\nAt the same time, it’s smart to learn what actually makes you look awesome and shows that you’re an adult with good taste. You may love and feel good wearing garbage bags, but that’s not exactly striking the balance between feeling good / comfortable, and being perceived as a grown ass man with, you know, taste… and a job.\nBefore I go too far off on a tangent\n… here are three ways you can embrace trends (and incorporate them daily) without completely victimizing yourself.\n1.) One trendy thing at a time\nAny more than that and you approach #menswear peacock status.\nLet me be more specific. If it’s a significant piece of your wardrobe (i.e. Go-to-Hell pants), then tone it down on all the other trendy items on your bod that day.\nIf they’re more subtle, you can probably get away with two or three. So if we’re referring to this photo from GQ, wrist decor like a watch, bracelets, etc, bold socks, and a pocket square are all technically okay to wear at once. It’s when you include all 18 things on this list that you start to peacock the F out, and things just get weird.\n2.) Mix your trends with classic styles\nSo the overall idea here is to be classic and understated, but with a few pops of “F you” and “Go To Hell” here and there.\nThe #menswear peacock in the image above is classic to a certain extent (traditional silhouettes with a modern slant, overall good taste) but then he takes it to a whole different level with the way he’s executing it: Loud colors, over-accessorizing, and including every imaginable up-to-the-moment trend.\nAgain, it’s cool rocking a few of these things (max) at a time, just keep it understated overall.\nThink about when you buy a really awesome garment, and you discover a hidden detail the designer included that no one knows about but you. You want to treat your accessories and trends that way. Do it, but don’t be obnoxious about it. A peek of color here, a crazy brogue paired with a quiet outfit. You get what I’m saying?\n3.) Do the complete opposite\nAre fedoras and trilbies the “in” headgear at the moment? Rock your dad’s old baseball cap. I just whipped out this old Polo Sport cap from my closet back home—much to K’s dismay—and I’m rockin it all the time as if it’s 1996 again.\nEveryone has 10+ bracelets on their wrists? Wear your best watch, and that’s it.\nGo the opposite direction of wherever the trend is headed. Oftentimes trends balloon to excessive proportions before they’re dialed back down again, so forge your own path and do whatever everyone else ISN’T doing.\nJust to clarify, I’m not saying put on your old JNCO wide leg jeans and cheap leather square-toed shoes… that’s a path no one should ever go back down.\nYou can and should adopt certain trends as long as you do it in moderation.\nSo let me open up the floor to you guys: what other ways can you embrace trends without looking like a complete #menswear peacock / fashion victim? If you have suggestions / ideas / questions, let’s hear em below in the comments.\nps — tomorrow’s the last day to pick up The Effortless Guide to Graduating Your Style (GYS) with the BONUS bonus, Does This Go With That?

{"doc": {"text": "Lord British was killed during an in-game appearance on Ultima Online’s beta test on August 8, 1997. A royal visit was conducted as a part of server population stress test. A player character known as Rainz cast a spell called “fire field” on Lord British that, surprisingly, killed him. According to Starr Long, the whole thing was just a human error: Lord British’s character, like others, had been made invulnerable, but by design the invulnerability did not persist over several game sessions. Shortly before the incident, the server had crashed, and Richard Garriott had forgotten to set his invulnerability flag on when logging on again. Shortly afterwards, Rainz’s account was banned from the beta test for previously exploiting bugs rather than reporting them (infamously used by his character Aquaman to kill many player characters, a purported griefing incident). According to Origin, he was not banned for the assassination but rather for previous complaints against his account that were brought to light as a result of this attention. The massive amount of lag, caused by the stress test, was a factor in Lord British’s death, as well as the guards being deactivated in the area, which allowed Rainz to steal, avoiding immediate death. 99% of the players were at Lord British’s castle. Only the few at Lord Blackthorn’s castle were the lucky witnesses to this historic event. Those known to have been present besides Lords British and Blackthorn were their jesters Chuckles and Heckles and the following players; Rainz, Dr.Pepper, Mental, DemonSoth, Haaaaaach, Helios, Phobos, Gildoreal, Wind Lord and Kylan.\n3) The Epic Heist – EVE Online – November 2005″\nThis was published in September’s 2005 issue of PC Gamer UK. It is a detailed account of what has to be one of most beautifully executed in-game scams in a MMORPG ever pulled. It breaks all previous world records for ‘virtual crime’.\nThe game in question is Eve Online, where corporate espionage and political intrigue have become an integral part of the game.\nThe perpetrator of the heist was the Guiding Hand Social Club (GHSC) corporation (a corporation being similar to a clan in Eve); a freelance mercenary outfit that offers their services (which usually involves corp infiltration, theft and assassination) to the highest bidder. Over a year in planning, the GHSC infilitrated their target’s corp with their own members and gained their trust, as well as access to the corp hangers, with time. It all concluded in a perfectly timed climax, with a massive theft in multiple corp hangars synchronized with the in-game killing of the corporation’s CEO, the primary target of the contract.\nWhat’s most interesting and impressive about this operation is that it was entirely ‘legal’ and within the game’s own rules, and the mastermind and his agents pulled it off together flawlessly, all the while staying in character. The estimated real-life value of the items stolen is, according to PC Gamer, $16,500 US. The in-game value of course is much, much higher as the things stolen would take years and years to aquire.\n4) Plague Outbreak – World of Warcraft – September 2005\nThe Corrupted Blood plague incident was one of the first events to affect entire World of Warcraft servers. Patch 1.7 saw the opening of Zul’Gurub, the game’s first 20-player raid dungeon where players faced off against an ancient tribe of jungle trolls under the sway of the ancient Blood God, Hakkar the Soulflayer. Upon engaging Hakkar, players were stricken by a debuff (a spell that negatively affects a player) called “Corrupted Blood” which would periodically sap their life. The disease would also be passed on to other players who were simply standing in close proximity to an infected person. Originally this malady was confined within the Zul’Gurub instance but made its way into the outside world by way of hunter or warlock pets that contracted the disease.\nWithin hours Corrupted Blood had infected entire cities such as Ironforge and Orgrimmar because of their high player concentrations. Low-level players were killed in seconds by the high-damage disease. Eventually Blizzard fixed the issue so that the plague could not exist outside of Zul’Gurub.\n5) Death of the Sleeper – EverQuest – November 15-17, 2003\nThe guild Blood of the Spider on The Rathe server was the first guild system-wide to kill Ventani (the fourth warder) on July 28, 2001, and therefore wake the sleeper. The event caused a stir on the server when Kerafyrm went into multiple zones, including Skyshrine, killing everyone and everything in his path.\nOn November 15, 2003, on the Rallos Zek PvP server, the three top guilds (Ascending Dawn, Wudan, and Magus Imperialis Magicus) assembled over 180 players with the intent to wake and kill The Sleeper. This was in response to an attempt to wake The Sleeper by an Iksar monk named Stynkfyst, who partnered with the largest random-pk guild of the time. Having been a former member of uber-guild Ascending Dawn, he had the knowledge the random pk guild needed to wake The Sleeper. The top guilds did not assemble their forces until word of Stynkfyst’s intentions had spread, and it became clear that he intended to wake The Sleeper, forever preventing future guilds from farming the old loot table. Until this point, waking The Sleeper had not been seriously considered by any guilds, as it was believed that waking The Sleeper would make the offending guild’s players kill-on-sight to the other guilds of the server. After 3 hours and 15 minutes, at 26% health, Kerafyrm disappeared (despawned). The players talked with the EverQuest Game Masters, and there was a general consensus that a bug had caused the problem, although some suggested (backed by statements from one GM) that higher-ups at SOE had purposely despawned Kerafyrm, because it was not intended to be part of the story.\nThe following day, the players logged in to find that Kerafyrm was back in his “sleeping” state, ready to be triggered again. There was also an apology on the official EverQuest forums from SOE, explaining that they had stopped the encounter because they feared the players were engaging the boss in an unintended manner. Although annoyed (the players pointed out that the reasons SOE gave could not have occurred, and felt lied to), they attempted to battle Kerafyrm once again.\nOn November 17, 2003, after a nearly 3-hour battle, Kerafyrm was defeated. He had between 100 million and 400 million hit points, likely around 250 million (most EverQuest bosses have 2 million at most), was immune to all spells except wizard’s manaburn spell and Shadow Knight’s Harm Touch, possessed two death touch abilities (abilities that automatically killed players), and attacked players for 6999 damage per swing. By using the cleric’s epic weapon and other resurrection spells, the players were able to bring their dead characters back into the battle faster than Kerafyrm could kill them all.", "id": "<urn:uuid:254fdcc9-84ad-4754-8abe-c3afb3c20a3f>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://lorehound.com/tag/death-of-the-sleeper/", "date": "2013-05-24T08:42:51Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368704392896/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516113952-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.979398250579834, "token_count": 1564}, "content": [{"line": "Lord British was killed during an in-game appearance on Ultima Online’s beta test on August 8, 1997.

Having been a former member of uber-guild Ascending Dawn, he had the knowledge the random pk guild needed to wake The Sleeper. The top guilds did not assemble their forces until word of Stynkfyst’s intentions had spread, and it became clear that he intended to wake The Sleeper, forever preventing future guilds from farming the old loot table. Until this point, waking The Sleeper had not been seriously considered by any guilds, as it was believed that waking The Sleeper would make the offending guild’s players kill-on-sight to the other guilds of the server. After 3 hours and 15 minutes, at 26% health, Kerafyrm disappeared (despawned).

{"doc": {"text": "What is services marketing?\nA service is the action of doing something for someone or something. It is largely intangible (i.e. not material). You cannot touch it. You cannot see it. You cannot taste it. You cannot hear it. You cannot feel it. So a service context creates its own series of challenges for the marketing manager since he or she must communicate the benefits of a service by drawing parallels with imagery and ideas that are more tangible.\nA product is tangible (i.e. material) since you can touch it or own it. A service tends to be an experience that is consumed at the point where it is purchased and cannot be owned since it quickly perishes. A person could go to a café one day and enjoy excellent service, and then return the next day and have a poor experience. Marketers talk about the nature of a service as being inseparable, intangible, perishable, homogenous and variable.\nInseparable - from the point where it is consumed, and from the provider of the service. For example, you cannot take a live theatre performance home to consume it (a DVD of the same performance would be a product, not a service). The consumer is actually involved in the production process that they are buying at the same time as it is being produced, for example an eye test or a makeover. One benefit would be that if you are unhappy with you makeover you can tell the beautician and that instant feedback means that the service quality is improved. You can't do that with a product. Another attribute is that services have to be close to the person consuming them i.e. goods can be made in a central factory location which has the benefits of mass production. This localization means that consumption is inseparable from production.\nIntangible - cannot have a real, physical presence as does a product. For example, motor insurance may have a certificate, but the financial service itself cannot be touched i.e. it is intangible. This makes it tricky to evaluate the quality of service prior to consuming it since there are fewer attributes of quality in comparison to a product. One way is to consider quality in terms of search, experience and credence.\nSearch quality is the perception in the mind of the consumer of the quality of the product prior to purchase through making a series of searches. So this is simple in relation to a tangible product because you might look at size or colour for example. Therefore search quality relates more to products and services.\nExperience quality is easier to assess. In terms of service you need to taste the food or experience the service level. Therefore your experiences allow you to evaluate the level and nature of the service. You remember a great vacation because of the food or service, but by the same token you remember an awful vacation because of the hopeless food or poor service.\nCredence quality is based upon the credibility of the service that you undertake. This is down to the reputation of a dentist or of a decorator. Credence is used where you have little knowledge of the topic and where you rely upon the professionalism of the expert.\nPerishable - in that once it has occurred it cannot be repeated in exactly the same way. For example, once a 100 meters Olympic final has been run, there will not be another for 4 more years, and even then it will be staged in a different place with many different finalists. You cannot put service in the warehouse, or store in your inventory. An interesting argument about perishability goes like this, once a flight has taken off you cannot sell that seat again, hence the airline makes no profit on that seat. Therefore the airline has no choice but to price at peak when it sells a seat at busy times in order to make a profit. That's why restaurants offer vouchers to compensate for quieter times, and it is the same for railway tickets and matinees in Broadway during the middle of the week.\nVariability- since the human involvement in service provision means that no two services will be completely identical, they are variable. For example, returning to the same garage time and time again for a service on your car might see different levels of customer satisfaction, or speediness of work. If you watch your favourite/favorite music group on DVD the experience will be the same every time you play it, although if you go to see them on tour when they are live no two performances will be identical for a whole variety of reasons. Even with the greatly standardized McDonalds experience, there are slight changes in service, often through no fault of the business itself. Sometimes Saturday lunchtime will be extremely busy, on other days you may have to wait to go via the drive through. So services tend to vary from one user experience to another.\nHomogeneity is where services are largely the same (the opposite of variability above). We considered McDonald's above which is a largely homogeneous service, so now let's look at KFC and Pizza Hut. Both of these businesses provide a homogeneous service experience whether you are in New York, or Alaska, or even Adelaide. Consumers expect the same level of service and would not anticipate any huge deviation in their experience. Outside of the main brands you might expect a less homogeneous experience. If you visit your doctor he or she might give one interpretation, whereas another doctor might offer a different view. Your regular hairdresser will deliver a style whereas a hairdresser in the next town could potentially style your hair differently. Therefore standardization is largely embodied by the large global brands which produce services.\nRight of ownership is not taken to the service, since you merely experience it.

It is largely intangible (i.e. not material). You cannot touch it. You cannot see it. You cannot taste it. You cannot hear it. You cannot feel it. So a service context creates its own series of challenges for the marketing manager since he or she must communicate the benefits of a service by drawing parallels with imagery and ideas that are more tangible.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "A product is tangible (i.e. material) since you can touch it or own it. A service tends to be an experience that is consumed at the point where it is purchased and cannot be owned since it quickly perishes. A person could go to a café one day and enjoy excellent service, and then return the next day and have a poor experience. Marketers talk about the nature of a service as being inseparable, intangible, perishable, homogenous and variable.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Inseparable - from the point where it is consumed, and from the provider of the service. For example, you cannot take a live theatre performance home to consume it (a DVD of the same performance would be a product, not a service). The consumer is actually involved in the production process that they are buying at the same time as it is being produced, for example an eye test or a makeover. One benefit would be that if you are unhappy with you makeover you can tell the beautician and that instant feedback means that the service quality is improved. You can't do that with a product. Another attribute is that services have to be close to the person consuming them i.e. goods can be made in a central factory location which has the benefits of mass production. This localization means that consumption is inseparable from production.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Intangible - cannot have a real, physical presence as does a product. For example, motor insurance may have a certificate, but the financial service itself cannot be touched i.e. it is intangible. This makes it tricky to evaluate the quality of service prior to consuming it since there are fewer attributes of quality in comparison to a product. One way is to consider quality in terms of search, experience and credence.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Search quality is the perception in the mind of the consumer of the quality of the product prior to purchase through making a series of searches. So this is simple in relation to a tangible product because you might look at size or colour for example. Therefore search quality relates more to products and services.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Experience quality is easier to assess. In terms of service you need to taste the food or experience the service level. Therefore your experiences allow you to evaluate the level and nature of the service. You remember a great vacation because of the food or service, but by the same token you remember an awful vacation because of the hopeless food or poor service.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Credence quality is based upon the credibility of the service that you undertake.

Credence is used where you have little knowledge of the topic and where you rely upon the professionalism of the expert.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Perishable - in that once it has occurred it cannot be repeated in exactly the same way. For example, once a 100 meters Olympic final has been run, there will not be another for 4 more years, and even then it will be staged in a different place with many different finalists. You cannot put service in the warehouse, or store in your inventory. An interesting argument about perishability goes like this, once a flight has taken off you cannot sell that seat again, hence the airline makes no profit on that seat. Therefore the airline has no choice but to price at peak when it sells a seat at busy times in order to make a profit. That's why restaurants offer vouchers to compensate for quieter times, and it is the same for railway tickets and matinees in Broadway during the middle of the week.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Variability- since the human involvement in service provision means that no two services will be completely identical, they are variable. For example, returning to the same garage time and time again for a service on your car might see different levels of customer satisfaction, or speediness of work. If you watch your favourite/favorite music group on DVD the experience will be the same every time you play it, although if you go to see them on tour when they are live no two performances will be identical for a whole variety of reasons. Even with the greatly standardized McDonalds experience, there are slight changes in service, often through no fault of the business itself. Sometimes Saturday lunchtime will be extremely busy, on other days you may have to wait to go via the drive through. So services tend to vary from one user experience to another.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Homogeneity is where services are largely the same (the opposite of variability above). We considered McDonald's above which is a largely homogeneous service, so now let's look at KFC and Pizza Hut. Both of these businesses provide a homogeneous service experience whether you are in New York, or Alaska, or even Adelaide. Consumers expect the same level of service and would not anticipate any huge deviation in their experience. Outside of the main brands you might expect a less homogeneous experience. If you visit your doctor he or she might give one interpretation, whereas another doctor might offer a different view. Your regular hairdresser will deliver a style whereas a hairdresser in the next town could potentially style your hair differently. Therefore standardization is largely embodied by the large global brands which produce services.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Right of ownership is not taken to the service, since you merely experience it.

{"doc": {"text": "BELATEDLY, assessments in New York City rose in the mid-80's to reflect the growth in market values. And now, again belatedly, they have begun to drop to reflect the decline.\nThe 7 percent drop in overall assessments may have been the most significant news embedded in the tentative assessment roll for the 1992 fiscal year made public at City Hall last month. It has been overshadowed for the moment by the awkwardly timed effort by the Dinkins administration to raise as much as $800 million more from the property tax than it is producing this year. To do that, tax rates will have to rise.\nHomeowners on average would find their taxes going up about $300 a year from the average bill of $1,340 in the current year. Taxes on apartments -- rentals, co-ops and condominiums -- would on average go up about $230 a unit from a base of $1,430.\nThe biggest blow would fall on commercial property in Class 4, where billable assessments are still rising from past assessment increases on which taxes are being phased in. Additionally there would be a tax-rate increase of about 12 percent if Mayor David N. Dinkins's fiscal plan is fully enacted.\nProperty taxes in Class 4 would reach a level approximately double what they were in 1987, according to the Real Estate Board of New York. The year-to-year increase averages out to $1.28 a square foot. For a 10,000-square-foot office tenant, this is a $12,800-a-year rent increase, since tax increases are passed on under standard leases.\nApart from the anomaly of falling assessments and rising property taxes, however, the roll has an interest in its own right. It is the first to be produced under the leadership of Carol O'Cleireican, an economist, as Finance Commissioner. She has pledged a new openness and fairness in the property assessment system. On the first point, she has already made a notable contribution. But on the second, well-wishers may be permitted skepticism. Unfairness in terms of the ratios of assessed values to market values is legislatively built into New York City's assessment system. An argument can be made that the situation is growing worse.\n\"I know that reform will not be easy,\" said the Commissioner in a statement that accompanied the publication of the roll, which will become final following adjustments made by the Tax Commission after an appeals period. \"But every long journey begins with a first step.\"\nThe first steps toward openness have already been taken. This year the Finance Department disclosed to the owners of income-producing properties the figures known as capitalization rates that assessors assign to categories of income-producing property. The assigned rate reflects their judgment of the current value of a building's income stream, or rents after operating expenses are deducted, to a buyer. Rates are influenced largely by geographic location and building age. The lower the rate, the higher the presumed value.\nFor example, if the net income is $100,000 and the assessors use an 8 percent capitalization rate, the assessed value would be $1.25 million.

{"doc": {"text": "At midday a light snow began to fall; the white was a welcome sight. While parts of the country are shoveling out, we here in southwest Wisconsin have needed only a broom. The ground here has been bare most of the winter. It's been great for the farmers who try to get their corn and soybeans harvested before the snow flies.\nBy late afternoon there was an inch of new white snow on everything--the ground, trees, fence posts, bushes, everywhere. It was nice to see something bright. In Wisconsin, winter just doesn't seem like winter without some snow. I've been itching to slide down a hill on a sled, but I need at least three or four inches before it's soft enough to cushion these old bones. The birds at the birdfeeders seemed extra busy this morning. Blue jays called and flew off in several directions. A pair of cardinals flew by me as I stood in the snow. A gang of black crows sailed high overhead, calling out to me as they passed by.\nI noticed a pair of jay-sized birds coming at me from the south and passing right over my head. There was no doubt they were robins. This was a nice treat, even though I saw them for only a few seconds. I think the birds knew there was snow on the way, and when they are busy, they tend to add more life at the start of a day. I broomed the snow off the woodpile and picked up three heavy chunks of split hickory. As I climbed the steps, I wondered where those two robins were headed and where they have been. I can't remember the last time I didn't see a robin in the winter, but it's been at least five years. Seeing the first return of a robin in the spring is not so shocking when you know a few are hanging around all winter. These winter robins are shy and rarely will come to the bird feeders. They prefer to fend for themselves, and they are good at it. They will gladly eat the nutritious berries of chokecherry, wild grapes, serviceberry, and highbush cranberry, but the winter robins' favorite food is the seed found in the dark red tops of the sumac.\nOver the years I have shared many winter stories with my readers--stories of the tracks in the deep snow as the landscape turns white. For me it meant a chance to write about how the wildlife survives in a snowy world. So I, for one, am looking for more snow.\nAn Amish farmer told me the other day about seeing a large white bird on top of a fence post in a hayfield. This, of course, made me very curious, so I had to ask him some more questions. He said the bird was over a foot tall, but seemed to be huddled down over the top of the post. The bird was a hundred yards away, but it looked like there may have been some black spots on its white feathers. The farmer's excellent description was of the great white owl, also known as the snowy owl.\nIt's always a wonderful treat to see one of these magnificent birds from the far north. Life can be very harsh on the Canadian tundra, and the snowy owl is used to cold winter weather. In the spring and summer they raise their young on the treeless landscape. Food is plentiful and the owls catch voles, lemmings, and flightless young birds. When winter comes, their true hunting skills surface, and they look for hares and ptarmigan. If the hunting is bad, many of these large white owls migrate across the northern boundaries of the U.S. in search of food.\nWith their large, keen yellow eyes, snowy owls can spot their next meal at a great distance. On huge and silent white wings, they glide low to the ground and surprise their prey. The female great white owl is larger, and her feathers may be heavily barred with black, while the smaller male is lightly barred or pure white. When everything is covered with snow, the great white owl is perfectly camouflaged to blend with its surroundings. With no snow on the ground, though, the snowy owl stands out like a sore thumb. I've spotted them a mile away, sitting motionless in a tree or on top of a fence post.

{"doc": {"text": "SCOTTSDALE -- The Arizona Fall League has long been recognized as Major League Baseball's \"graduate\" school, and on Saturday Paul Konerko picked up his honorary doctorate.Konerko was inducted as the 27th member of the AFL Hall of Fame in ceremonies prior to the Mesa-Salt River game at Salt River Fields at Talking Stick, and his No. 34 as third baseman of the 1996 Sun City Solar Sox was retired by the 20-year-old league. Ryan Howard, a member of the 2004 Phoenix Desert Dogs, is inductee No. 28 -- technically. The AFL doesn't formally induct honorees without their presence, and the Philadelphia first baseman is recovering from an operation on the Achilles tendon he had torn on the final play of the National League Division Series. Howard will be honored next year. So the 2011 spotlight shone solely on Konerko, a Scottsdale resident who became the first local product enshrined in the permanent Hall of Fame displayed in Scottsdale Stadium's concourse. \"I'm probably also the first member of the Hall of Fame who came to the games as a kid,\" said Konerko, whose family moved here from Rhode Island when he was 11. Considering about 3,400 prospects have played through the AFL -- more than 1,200 of them on their way to the big leagues -- inclusion among 28 Hall of Famers is certainly a prestigious honor. One definitely not bestowed upon Konerko for his play in the AFL. \"I wasn't too good when I played here,\" Konerko said, and the record books bear him out, as the Solar Sox's third baseman batted .212 with three homers and 22 RBIs in 44 games. At the time, Konerko was a top prospect in the Dodgers' system, and he also paused in Cincinnati prior to arriving in Chicago, where he made his mark on the South Side. The five-time All-Star recently finished his seventh season with 30-plus homers and his ninth with at least 90 RBIs. Konerko called his induction into one of the few Hall of Fames one may enter while still active \"a most pleasant stepping stone.\" \"The AFL has grown up, with more stadiums now, but the core of why it started is the same,\" Konerko said. \"Every organization sends a handful of guys, they're all put together and given a chance to see their best competition. \"They grow and become polished together. Ninety percent of these guys will be playing against each other for the next 10 years,\" added the first baseman and captain -- but not manager -- of the Chicago White Sox. Konerko admitted being taken by surprise by White Sox general manager Ken Williams' admission -- after having already chosen Robin Ventura to replace Ozzie Guillen -- that he had considered Konerko as a player-manager. \"That was never even mentioned,\" Konerko said. \"I saw it in the paper, then got a million phone calls, but it was never something that was brought up to me before the manager was announced. \"To tell you the truth, I've never thought about managing, not really. It was definitely flattering, but I really have no desire to do that. But I guess it was a compliment.\" Did being mentioned in that context put Konerko on the map as a future candidate to manage? \"In my opinion, I do not see myself ever wanting to do that,\" he said. \"But if you go back to 10 years ago, Robin Ventura probably would've said he doesn't want to manage, either, so you never say never. But as of right now, I don't see myself managing in baseball at any level when I'm done.\" That will come as a disappointment to Roland Hemond, a former White Sox executive and a principal founder of the AFL. During Saturday's induction ceremony, Hemond looked forward to \"taking great pleasure in seeing this man's career continue.\" And when the time was right, Hemond said, Konerko \"would make a great manager in the Arizona Fall League.\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:6300379b-545c-4b31-baa3-0786f9e9323b>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20111022&content_id=25748978&vkey=news_cws&c_id=cws", "date": "2013-06-18T22:58:02Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368707435344/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516123035-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9870550632476807, "token_count": 832}, "content": [{"line": "", "label": "clean", "split": true}, {"line": "SCOTTSDALE -- The Arizona Fall League has long been recognized as Major League Baseball's \"graduate\" school, and on Saturday Paul Konerko picked up his honorary doctorate.Konerko was inducted as the 27th member of the AFL Hall of Fame in ceremonies prior to the Mesa-Salt River game at Salt River Fields at Talking Stick, and his No.", "label": "clean", "split": true}, {"line": "34 as third baseman of the 1996 Sun City Solar Sox was retired by the 20-year-old league.

{"doc": {"text": "Psalm CXXVI. 5492\n1. …How man had come into captivity, let us ask the Apostle Paul.…For he saith: “For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin.” 5493 Behold whence we became captives; because we were sold under sin. Who sold us? We ourselves, who consented to the seducer. We could sell ourselves; we could not redeem ourselves. We sold ourselves by consent of sin, we are redeemed in the faith of righteousness. For innocent blood was given for us, that we might be redeemed. Whatsoever blood he shed in persecuting the righteous, what kind of blood did he shed? Righteous mens blood, indeed, he shed; they were Prophets, righteous men, our fathers, and Martyrs. Whose blood he shed, yet all coming of the offspring of sin. One blood he shed of Him who was not justified, 5494 but born righteous: by shedding that blood, he lost those whom he held. For they p. 604 for whom innocent blood was given were redeemed, and, turned back from their captivity, they sing this Psalm.\n2. “When the Lord turned back the captivity of Sion, we became as those that are comforted” (Psa. 126.1). He meant by this to say, we became joyful. When? “When the Lord turned back the captivity of Sion.” What is Sion? Jerusalem, the same is also the eternal Sion. How is Sion eternal, how is Sion captive? In angels eternal, in men captive. For not all the citizens of that city are captives, but those who are away from thence, they are captives. Man was a citizen of Jerusalem, but sold under sin he became a pilgrim. Of his progeny was born the human race, and the captivity of Sion filled all lands. And how is this captivity of Sion a shadow of that Jerusalem? The shadow of that Sion, which was granted to the Jews, in an image, in a figure, was in captivity in Babylonia, and after seventy years that people turned back to its own city. 5495 …But when all time is past, then we return to our country, as after seventy years that people returned from the Babylonish captivity, for Babylon is this world; since Babylon is interpreted “confusion.”…So then this whole life of human affairs is confusion, which belongeth not unto God. In this confusion, in this Babylonish land, Sion is held captive. But “the Lord hath turned back the captivity of Sion.” “And we became,” he saith, “as those that are comforted.” That is, we rejoiced as receiving consolation. Consolation is not save for the unhappy, consolation is not save for them that groan, that mourn. Wherefore, “as those that are comforted,” except because we are still mourning? We mourn for our present lot, we are comforted in hope: when the present is passed by, of our mourning will come everlasting joy, when there will be no need of consolation, because we shall be wounded with no distress. But wherefore saith he “as” those that are comforted, and saith not comforted? This word “as,” is not always put for likeness: when we say “As,” it sometimes refers to the actual case, sometimes to likeness: here it is with reference to the actual case.…Walk therefore in Christ, and sing rejoicing, sing as one that is comforted; because He went before thee who hath commanded thee to follow Him.\n3. “Then was our mouth filled with joy, and our tongue with exultation” (Psa. 126.2). That mouth, brethren, which we have in our body, how is it “filled with joy”? It useth not to be “filled,” save with meat, or drink, or some such thing put into the mouth. Sometimes our mouth is filled; and it is more that we say to your holiness, 5496 when we have our mouth full, we cannot speak. But we have a mouth within, that is, in the heart, whence whatsoever proceedeth, if it is evil, defileth us, if it is good, cleanseth us. For concerning this very mouth ye heard when the Gospel was read. For the Jews reproached the Lord, because His disciples ate with unwashen hands. 5497 They reproached who had cleanness without; and within were full of stains. They reproached, whose righteousness was only in the eyes of men. But the Lord sought our inward cleanness, which if we have, the outside must needs be clean also. “Cleanse,” He saith, “the inside,” and “the outside shall be clean also.” 5498 …\n4. But let us return to what was just now read from the Gospel, relating to the verse before us, “Our mouth was filled with joy, and our tongue with delight:” for we are inquiring what mouth and what tongue. Listen, beloved brethren. The Lord was scoffed at, because His disciples ate with unwashed hands. The Lord answered them as was fitting, and said unto the crowds whom He had called unto Him, “Hear ye all, and understand: not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.” 5499 What is this? when He said, what goeth into the mouth, He meant only the mouth of the body. For meat goeth in, and meats defile not a man; because, “All things are clean to the clean;” and, “every creature of God is good, and none to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving.” 5500 …\n5. Guard the mouth of thy heart from evil, and thou wilt be innocent: the tongue of thy body will be innocent, thy hands will be innocent; even thy feet will be innocent, thy eyes, thy ears, will be innocent; all thy members will serve under righteousness, because a righteous commander hath thy heart. “Then shall they say among the heathen, the Lord hath done great things for them.”\n6. “Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already, whereof we rejoice” (Psa. 126.3). Consider, my brethren, if Sion doth not at present say this among the heathen, throughout the whole world; consider if men are not running unto the Church. In the whole world our redemption is received; Amen is answered. The dwellers in Jerusalem, therefore, captive, destined to return, pilgrims, sighing for their country, speak thus among the heathen. What do they say? “The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we rejoice.” Have they done anything for themselves? They have done ill with themselves, for they have sold themselves under sin. The Redeemer came, and did the good things for them.\n7. “Turn our captivity, O Lord, as the torrents in the south” (Psa. 126.4). Consider, my p. 605 brethren, what this meaneth.…As torrents are turned in the south, so turn our captivity. In a certain passage Scripture saith, in admonishing us concerning good works, “Thy sins also shall melt away, even as the ice in fair warm weather.” 5501 Our sins therefore bound us. How? As the cold bindeth the water that it run not. Bound with the frost of our sins, we have frozen. But the south wind is a warm wind: when the south wind blows, the ice melts, and the torrents are filled. Now winter streams are called torrents; for filled with sudden rains they run with great force. We had therefore become frozen in captivity; our sins bound us: the south wind the Holy Spirit hath blown: our sins are forgiven us, we are released from the frost of iniquity; as the ice in fair weather, our sins are melted. Let us run unto our country, as the torrents in the south.…\n8. For the next words are, “They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy” (Psa. 126.5). In this life, which is full of tears, let us sow. What shall we sow? Good works. Works of mercy are our seeds: of which seeds the Apostle saith, “Let us not be weary in well doing; for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.” 5502 Speaking therefore of almsgiving itself, what saith he? “This I say; he that soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly.” 5503 He therefore who soweth plentifully, shall reap plentifully: he who soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly: and he that soweth nothing, shall reap nothing. Why do ye long for ample estates, where ye may sow plentifully? There is not a wider field on which ye can sow than Christ, who hath willed that we should sow in Himself. Your soil is the Church; sow as much as ye can. But thou hast not enough to do this. Hast thou the will? 5504 As what thou hadst would be nothing, if thou hadst not a good will; so do not despond, because thou hast not, if thou hast a good will. For what dost thou sow? Mercy. And what wilt thou reap? Peace. Said the Angels, Peace on earth unto rich men? No, but, “Peace on earth unto men of a good will.” 5505 Zacchæus had a strong will, Zacchæus had great charity. 5506 …Did then that widow who cast her two farthings into the treasury, sow little? Nay, as much as Zacchæus. For she had narrower means, but an equal will. She gave her two mites 5507 with as good a will as Zacchæus gave the half of his patrimony. If thou consider what they gave, thou wilt find their gifts different; if thou look to the source, thou wilt find them equal; she gave whatever she had, and he gave what he had.…But if they are beggars whose profession is asking alms, in trouble they also have what to bestow upon one another. God hath not so forsaken them, but that they have wherein they may be tried by their bestowing of alms. This man cannot walk; he who can walk, lendeth his feet to the lame; he who seeth, lendeth his eyes to the blind; and he who is young and sound, lendeth his strength to the old or the infirm, carrieth him: the one is poor, the other is rich.\n9. Sometimes also the rich man is found to be poor, and something is bestowed upon him by the poor. Somebody cometh to a river, so much the more delicate as he is more rich; he cannot pass over: if he were to pass over with bare limbs, he would catch cold, would be ill, would die: a poor man more active in body cometh up: he carries the rich man over; he giveth alms unto the rich. Think not therefore those only poor, who have not money.…Thus love ye, thus be ye affectioned unto one another. Attend not solely to yourselves: but to those who are in want around you. But because these things take place in this life with troubles and cares, faint not. Ye sow in tears, ye shall reap in joy.\n10. How, my brethren? When the farmer goeth forth with the plough, carrying seed, is not the wind sometimes keen, and doth not the shower sometimes deter him? He looketh to the sky, seeth it lowering, shivers with cold, nevertheless goeth forth, and soweth. For he feareth lest while he is observing the foul weather, and awaiting sunshine, the time may pass away, and he may not find anything to reap. Put not off, my brethren; sow in wintry weather, sow good works, even while ye weep; for, “They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy.” They sow their seed, good will, and good works. “They went on their way and wept, casting their seed” (Psa. 126.6). Why did they weep? Because they were among the miserable, and were themselves miserable. It is better, my brethren, that no man should be miserable, than that thou shouldest do alms.…Nevertheless, as long as there are objects for its exercise, let us not fail amid those troubles to sow our seed. Although we sow in tears, yet shall we reap in joy. For in that resurrection of the dead, each man shall receive his own sheaves, that is, the produce of his seed, the crown of joys and of delight. Then will there be a joyous triumph, when we shall laugh at death, wherein we groaned before: then shall they say to death, “O death, where is thy strife? O death, where is thy sting?” 5508 But why do they now rejoice? Because “they bring their sheaves with them.”\n11. In this Psalm we have chiefly exhorted you to do deeds of alms, because it is thence that we ascend; and ye see that he who ascendp. 606 eth, singeth the song of steps. Remember: do not love to descend, instead of to ascend, but reflect upon your ascent: because he who descended from Jerusalem to Jericho fell among thieves. 5509 …The Samaritan as He passed by slighted us not: He healed us, He raised us upon His beast, upon His flesh; He led us to the inn, that is, the Church; He entrusted us to the host, that is, to the Apostle; He gave two pence, whereby we might be healed, 5510 the love of God, and the love of our neighbour.

Who sold us? We ourselves, who consented to the seducer. We could sell ourselves; we could not redeem ourselves. We sold ourselves by consent of sin, we are redeemed in the faith of righteousness. For innocent blood was given for us, that we might be redeemed. Whatsoever blood he shed in persecuting the righteous, what kind of blood did he shed? Righteous mens blood, indeed, he shed; they were Prophets, righteous men, our fathers, and Martyrs. Whose blood he shed, yet all coming of the offspring of sin. One blood he shed of Him who was not justified, 5494 but born righteous: by shedding that blood, he lost those whom he held.

How is Sion eternal, how is Sion captive? In angels eternal, in men captive. For not all the citizens of that city are captives, but those who are away from thence, they are captives. Man was a citizen of Jerusalem, but sold under sin he became a pilgrim. Of his progeny was born the human race, and the captivity of Sion filled all lands. And how is this captivity of Sion a shadow of that Jerusalem? The shadow of that Sion, which was granted to the Jews, in an image, in a figure, was in captivity in Babylonia, and after seventy years that people turned back to its own city. 5495 …But when all time is past, then we return to our country, as after seventy years that people returned from the Babylonish captivity, for Babylon is this world; since Babylon is interpreted “confusion.”…So then this whole life of human affairs is confusion, which belongeth not unto God. In this confusion, in this Babylonish land, Sion is held captive. But “the Lord hath turned back the captivity of Sion.” “And we became,” he saith, “as those that are comforted.” That is, we rejoiced as receiving consolation. Consolation is not save for the unhappy, consolation is not save for them that groan, that mourn. Wherefore, “as those that are comforted,” except because we are still mourning? We mourn for our present lot, we are comforted in hope: when the present is passed by, of our mourning will come everlasting joy, when there will be no need of consolation, because we shall be wounded with no distress. But wherefore saith he “as” those that are comforted, and saith not comforted? This word “as,” is not always put for likeness: when we say “As,” it sometimes refers to the actual case, sometimes to likeness: here it is with reference to the actual case.…Walk therefore in Christ, and sing rejoicing, sing as one that is comforted; because He went before thee who hath commanded thee to follow Him.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "3. “Then was our mouth filled with joy, and our tongue with exultation” (Psa. 126.2).

Why do ye long for ample estates, where ye may sow plentifully? There is not a wider field on which ye can sow than Christ, who hath willed that we should sow in Himself. Your soil is the Church; sow as much as ye can. But thou hast not enough to do this. Hast thou the will? 5504 As what thou hadst would be nothing, if thou hadst not a good will; so do not despond, because thou hast not, if thou hast a good will. For what dost thou sow? Mercy. And what wilt thou reap? Peace. Said the Angels, Peace on earth unto rich men? No, but, “Peace on earth unto men of a good will.” 5505 Zacchæus had a strong will, Zacchæus had great charity. 5506 …Did then that widow who cast her two farthings into the treasury, sow little? Nay, as much as Zacchæus. For she had narrower means, but an equal will. She gave her two mites 5507 with as good a will as Zacchæus gave the half of his patrimony. If thou consider what they gave, thou wilt find their gifts different; if thou look to the source, thou wilt find them equal; she gave whatever she had, and he gave what he had.…But if they are beggars whose profession is asking alms, in trouble they also have what to bestow upon one another. God hath not so forsaken them, but that they have wherein they may be tried by their bestowing of alms. This man cannot walk; he who can walk, lendeth his feet to the lame; he who seeth, lendeth his eyes to the blind; and he who is young and sound, lendeth his strength to the old or the infirm, carrieth him: the one is poor, the other is rich.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "9.

Think not therefore those only poor, who have not money.…Thus love ye, thus be ye affectioned unto one another. Attend not solely to yourselves: but to those who are in want around you.

For he feareth lest while he is observing the foul weather, and awaiting sunshine, the time may pass away, and he may not find anything to reap. Put not off, my brethren; sow in wintry weather, sow good works, even while ye weep; for, “They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy.” They sow their seed, good will, and good works. “They went on their way and wept, casting their seed” (Psa. 126.6).

It is better, my brethren, that no man should be miserable, than that thou shouldest do alms.…Nevertheless, as long as there are objects for its exercise, let us not fail amid those troubles to sow our seed. Although we sow in tears, yet shall we reap in joy. For in that resurrection of the dead, each man shall receive his own sheaves, that is, the produce of his seed, the crown of joys and of delight. Then will there be a joyous triumph, when we shall laugh at death, wherein we groaned before: then shall they say to death, “O death, where is thy strife?

In response to a 2006 report of the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples, which highlighted the need for reforms to the specific claims process in several areas, the federal government launched Specific Claims: Justice at Last – Canada’s Specific Claims Action Plan in June 2007.

The Act creates the Specific Claims Tribunal, an administrative tribunal composed of Superior Court judges with authority to make binding decisions on claims and to award monetary compensation up to a maximum of $150 million per claim.\nThe Act stipulates that a First Nation may file a claim with the tribunal if the claim has been previously filed with the minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, and if:\nIn effect, the Specific Claims Tribunal Act introduces three-year timelines for the assessment and negotiation of specific claims. As a result of these timelines, certain cases will become eligible for filing with the tribunal as of 16 October 2011.\nWith this deadline in view, the Specific Claims Tribunal is currently preparing for the commencement of operations. Between November 2009 and November 2010, several Superior Court judges were appointed to the tribunal, and Justice Harry Slade was appointed as its chairperson. Draft Rules of Practice and Procedure were made public in June 2010 and are currently under review by the Department of Justice. The tribunal’s first annual report, dated 30 September 2010, provides a synopsis of work undertaken to that date and of anticipated activities through the current and following fiscal years.3\nThe introduction of the Specific Claims Tribunal Act in November 2007 was accompanied by the signing of a political agreement between the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations. The political agreement provides for additional discussion on improvements in the resolution of specific claims not directly addressed in the legislation, including matters related to claims that exceed the monetary cap of $150 million.

{"doc": {"text": "What Fred Wilpon told The New Yorker doesn't matter. It matters like a team that is 20 games out needs to set a postseason rotation. It matters like a guy on The Titanic needed to figure out how to survive The Great Depression. It mattered like calling the right play for the Washington Generals matters.\nThis will be a relic of Fred Wilpon's very late career as owner of the New York Mets. There's no realistic financial path forward for him.\nLet's stipulate the following: no one can predict the future. But when the Mets were in fourth place on September 1 of last year, 13 games out, no one treated it like a coin flip whether they'd make the playoffs or not. It wasn't going to happen, in all likelihood. And it didn't.\nAnyone who tries to tell you the Wilpons don't face the same kind of odds to hold onto this team, be it Fred Wilpon or anyone else, shouldn't be taken seriously. Let's be clear: if the long-discussed minority owner is found to give the Wilpons (or more accurately, Sterling Equities), that is reported to be, best-case, $200 million. With losses expected to be $70 million this year, a $22 million debt balloon payment due on Citi Field in June, and $25 million due back to Major League Baseball by the end of the season, that leaves around $85 million over, assuming no other expenses, planning for 2012 losses, or the next debt balloon payment on Citi Field.\nBut let's say the Wilpons hold onto that entire $85 million, and apply it toward the lawsuit they face from the Trustee for the Bernie Madoff victims, Irving Picard.\nPicard wants $1 billion. That's a lot more than $85 million.\nAnd let's paint the rosiest scenario- somehow, though Picard has been settling with people for 99 cents on the dollar, the Wilpons convince the bankruptcy judge to see things their way regarding Picard's allegations that they should have known Madoff was a fraud. (Remember, every time you hear the Wilpons or allies declare publicly that they didn't know, it doesn't matter. That's not the standard here.)\nEven then, the Wilpons owe $300 million in the cash in minus cash out formulation Picard has created for net winners. That's been litigated by Picard, regarding Madoff, before this bankruptcy judge.\nSo where are they getting that money in an absolute best-case scenario? And remember: they can't sell 49 percent of the team twice and still hold ownership.\nI suppose the absolute best-case scenario calls for all that, plus the judge ruling against himself, or Irving Picard having a change of heart, or the Sterling partners winning Powerball. And then again. And then again.\nBut every time you read a story about the financials of the New York Mets, if the Wilpons don't look like they are in fourth place, 13 games out, with a month to go, that reporter isn't paying attention, either.\nSo take Fred Wilpon's comments accordingly. They are shockingly stupid in terms of the effect on team morale and attendance. But financially, it is impossible to see how the Mets can afford Jose Reyes either way, and around the league, other teams already knew this. Carlos Beltran was a goner anyway.

{"doc": {"text": "Will county give low-income seniors the tax break OK'd by voters?\nPublished: Thursday, February 7, 2013 at 5:17 p.m.\nLast Modified: Thursday, February 7, 2013 at 5:17 p.m.\nLike many local residents Irvin Curtin was looking for a break — a tax break, to be specific.\nCurtin recently approached the County Commission to request implementation of Amendment 11, a newly passed provision to the state Constitution that grants certain low-income senior citizens a reduction in their property tax rates.\n\"I've lived a long time. I've seen so many property tax increases, and other kinds of tax increases, that it just boggles the mind. And I think this is a worthwhile thing,\" the Belleview-area retiree told the board.\nOne commissioner agreed, and one didn't, clearly indicating his opposition.\nWhich means any hope of relief for Curtin and other senior citizens in his situation are pinned on all three remaining commissioners being convinced to open another loophole in an already well ventilated property tax system.\nAmendment 11 authorizes cities and counties to enact a homestead exemption for people 65 and older who meet the following criteria: They must have a household income of less than $27,030; own a home whose market value is less than $250,000; and have lived in that home for at least 25 years.\nProponents say its passage would effectively eliminate property taxes for qualified homeowners.\nIn Marion County the reduction in revenue from enacting Amendment 11 would be miniscule. A county report estimates that qualified taxpayers collectively would save $162,234.\nCritics of Amendment 11 maintain that local governments just could not afford another tax break as revenues keep declining.\nAccording to an annual report Property Appraiser Villie Smith compiles about local land values, the state has authorized 38 tax breaks for property owners.\nThat includes exemptions for both land and for personal — or tangible — property.\nThe homestead exemption, which slashes up to $50,000 off the taxable value of residences, is the best known and most popular. It is claimed by about 93,000 homeowners in Marion County.\nOther tax breaks contained in Smith's report cover nearly 5,000 parcels of publicly owned land, including schools; 1,008 parcels owned by churches and charitable organizations, including health care providers; 11,146 parcels owned by widows and widowers; 6,816 parcels owned by the partially or totally disabled and the blind, including military veterans; 42 parcels set aside for environmental conservation; and 10 parcels owned by deployed military personnel.\nAcross the county, those exemptions reduced the overall taxable value of property by $6.4 billion in 2012.\nThose property tax breaks saved taxpayers across Marion County about $45.3 million last year. That's about $800,000 more than the $44.5 million the county budgeted for property tax revenues for 2013.\nIn his pro-Amendment 11 pitch to the County Commission, Curtin pointed out that he collects about $1,100 a month in Social Security, while his property taxes ran about $1,400 per year.\nHe added that he once used his federal income tax rebate to pay his property taxes, but could no longer do so after retiring.\nCurtin had an advocate on the board, Commissioner Earl Arnett, who dropped Amendment 11 on his colleagues on Tuesday as his first big policy issue.\nArnett argued that the public had clearly voiced its preference by overwhelmingly supporting Amendment 11.\nThe amendment was one of just three proposed changes to the Florida Constitution to pass last November. The other two also were property tax-related, providing breaks for families of military veterans or first responders.\nAmendment 11 received 61 percent of the vote statewide and 61 percent within Marion County.\n\"The voting public has told us, as commissioners, that they would like to see this exemption for our seniors,\" Arnett said.\n\"Most of our seniors that have owned a home for 25 years are responsible. They pay their taxes. They pay their mortgage. They just don't have the funds left for the nutrition that they need and for the prescriptions,\" Arnett said.\nYet Commissioner Stan McClain announced he would oppose Amendment 11 — as, he said, he has opposed other property tax exemptions.\nEvery new tax break, McClain said, requires other taxpayers \"to pick up the slack\" and creates a demand from other groups for even more tax exemptions.\n\"Pretty soon, there's going to be a small amount of people paying property tax,\" McClain said. \"We end up in a circular firing squad when we do this.\"\n\"It's not fair to everyone else. We have to think of the greater good of the community.\"\nIt's unclear when the board might reconsider Arnett's proposal.\nThe Marion County Commission also has taken a pass on a previous property tax exemption for senior citizens: an additional $25,000 claim for homesteaded property that was passed in 1998.\nThe cities of Belleview and McIntosh are the only local governments in Marion to adopt that tax break.\nIrvin, a 71-year-old retired life insurance salesman, said in an interview Thursday that he will be back at the next commission meeting to promote it again.\nHe said he could use the savings to help his wife purchase health insurance, which they cannot afford right now.\n\"I've been a taxpayer for 40 years, and I could use just a little help in my retirement,\" Irvin said. \"One day they might need a little help themselves.\"\nContact Bill Thompson at 867-4117 or email@example.com.\nAll rights reserved.

{"doc": {"text": "Justin Hamilton and Christopher Stern, co-owners of Hamilton Stern Construction LLC, finally can put their feet up and relax.\nAfter completing renovations on their headquarters in Pittsford, the duo have settled into the new home of their full-service construction management company.\nIn just more than two years, Hamilton Stern Construction has completed or begun work on a variety of commercial, health care, industrial and residential projects, ranging in cost from $25,000 to $5 million. Those projects include building renovations to the Niagara Falls Air Force Base, the build-out of Savers thrift store in Henrietta and the corporate offices of Chaintreuil Jensen and Stark Architects LLP.\nHamilton and Stern's dream of owning a business together began in 1998, when they met as teammates on the basketball team at Rochester Institute of Technology. They clicked instantly.\n\"We kind of knew right then and there that one day we would be working together,\" Stern said.\nBoth Stern and Hamilton were civil engineering majors. After graduating in 2003, they worked as project engineers at MLB Construction Services LLC in Ballston Spa, Saratoga County, before pursuing separate ventures.\nStern went to work as a project manager for LeCesse Construction Services LLC, a commercial construction management company with offices in Henrietta. Hamilton became a project manager for Mazzarella & Cannan LLC, a real estate development and property management company in Rochester.\nBoth Hamilton and Stern said the contacts they made working for those two companies served as the building blocks for their construction firm. The duo formed the company in early 2010, with two other employees.\nHamilton Stern Construction took shape in a temporary office on Humboldt Street in Rochester. The company's first major project came in May 2011, a 7,000-square-foot addition and renovation of Tire World Auto Service Center in Penfield. The renovations, completed in October, included a new showroom and an expansion from five to nine service bays.\nAs the project wrapped up, Hamilton Stern Construction was moved into its 5,000-square-foot office and warehouse space on Monroe Avenue in Pittsford. Stern and Hamilton spent the first few months working together in a small office in the building while their construction team completed renovations.\nThe space, which previously housed the Three Crowns gift shop, now features their offices, a spiral staircase, conference area and kitchen. Hamilton said the next step is hiring a receptionist as business picks up.\n\"We're growing to the point where we need help,\" Hamilton said. \"That's a good thing.\"\nThe firm has 12 employees, but each client still gets the services of either Hamilton or Stern.\n\"We're very hands-on.

{"doc": {"text": "In the golden age of the worker, when worker’s rights were freshly won and the unions were widely respected as groups that helped tip the scales away from the bourgeois and towards the proletariat, one of the greatest threats to the newly rejuvenated working class was automation. “One day, the robots will come and destroy everything we’ve worked for in the name of profit,” they would say. Instead, the robots came and made things more efficient, safer and increased productivity greatly. Then, the politicians and the upper class came and destroyed everything they worked for in the name of profit.\nIn our time, it is a pretty safe bet to say it is no longer a golden age for the worker. It is, however, seemingly a golden age for independent games. Enter Vessel, the fluid based puzzler and first game from the liberated ex-EA employees over at Strange Loop Games. Vessel approaches the automation issue from a steampunk perspective, where liquid based lifeforms called fluros have been invented by the game’s protagonist, who looks a surprising amount like Bruce Campbell, M. Arkwright. These creatures have become prevalent in society, taking over the majority of factory and manual labor jobs in almost every industry. As the story progresses, you come to find out that these formerly mindless creatures have begun to evolve and pursue their own goals. In the process, they’ve stopped a multitude of important machines. Ever the scientist, Arkwright decides to investigate the fluros’ evolution, repair the machines and find a way to bridge the gap between humanity and the fluros.\nThis story, like many indie games, is told in a very minimalistic way. There is no dialog, really, with the protagonist’s thoughts conveyed through journal entries that offer a small bit of insight into the game’s world – although they mostly exist to give you a basic rundown of the various mechanics that come into play. This leaves the real story, and especially the fairly surreal ending, mostly up to your interpretation. There are times where that can be a cop out, but this is not one of those times. I always found that games, and really all forms of entertainment, that use an “up to interpretation” story only work when the content is strong enough to prop it up, and Vessel’s certainly is.\nThe gameplay here absolutely shines. Strange Loop created their own engine from the ground up in order to handle the fairly complex fluid physics present here, and the attention to detail shines. The engine’s ability to handle dynamic liquid simulation puts Vessel a sea apart from its competition. The multiple different liquids all flow, accumulate, evaporate and react in a completely logical manner. Containers can fill up, overflow and be emptied. Pretty much anything you can do with water, you need to do in Vessel to make your way through its large amount of varied, and progressively more difficult, puzzles.\nI can’t put enough emphasis on how well designed those puzzles really are. Vessel is very well paced, and the way it introduces the game’s concepts steadily is novel. It doesn’t give you many clues as to what you should do with the knowledge it gives you, and there aren’t any big red arrows or signs saying “HIT THIS BUTTON” or “MAKE STEAM HERE” so you’ll have to do all the leg work yourself. Like the minimalism in the story, the minimalism in feedback given to the player works because of the way the game is made. Of course, a scientist wouldn’t need, or even want, everything spelled out to him easily. He would want to experiment, document and improve on his methods to solve these problems. Vessel, and its emphasis on the player figuring out the interactions between not just fluros and the environment, but fluros and other fluros, is as close to the scientific method as we are going to see in a puzzler.\nThese interactions between the various types of fluros, as well as the various types of material they can be made out of, comprise the bulk of the problem solving. Some levels will see you needing to open up a number of doors so you can place a fluro on a button, while others will need you to find ways for two fluros of differing materials to collide so that the gas or steam they create can open up a different area. It is quite a rewarding experience when you finally do get all your little water creatures and lava creatures and “You Can’t Do That on Television” slime creatures to do what you need them to do.\nEven Vessel’s aesthetics are exceptional. I always felt that, despite my “gameplay before graphics” attitude, it was the experiments with art direction indie games tend to take that really drew me to them originally. I was always a retro gamer. Even as games got more and more advanced, I still clung to my love of the 16 bit era. When the AAA console games started moving towards realism and billions of polygons, I was quite happy to find people creating 2D games still. The advancements in tech, and even in artistic ability, within the gaming industry have been so large that these 2D platformers and puzzlers end up looking just gorgeous. Vessel – with its colorful backgrounds and great lighting – is as good a looking as any indie game has ever been. The music even shines, as it features a number of pieces from well-known composer Jon Hopkins, all arranged adaptively. The music adjusts to what you are doing and it ends up adding so much to the game’s feel.\nWhile this all might sound entirely perfect, I have to burst the bubble a bit. There are some issues that show that Vessel is slightly wet behind the ears, with a handful of problems that break the fluidity of the game’s flow. Sorry, I’m way under my quota for liquid puns here. I have to catch up or else they revoke my membership to the Shitty Pun of the Month club.\nWhile the puzzles are legitimately among the most well designed I’ve seen in quite a while, the platforming elements fall a bit short. The controls aren’t always as responsive as you would like, and jumping can be a bit iffy in some situations. Also, for people who aren’t really used to using the brain pathways that lead to being good at puzzle games, Vessel’s lack of hand holding might be a significant barrier to enjoyment. Most stages are intuitive enough that you’ll figure it out, but some take a significant amount of experimenting. There are even a few that suffer from design choices, like one type of fluros that will follow you around and hit switches but is frustratingly slow, or a puzzle where you know exactly what you have to do but simply can’t get the fluros to cooperate.\nCompared to the rest of the game, these problems are barely spit in the ocean of awesomeness. Vessel is easily one of, if not the best, indie games of 2012 so far. It is well designed, gorgeous to look at, and incredibly entertaining. Strange Loops has created a game that is more coheisive than most, with absolutely everything – from the graphics to the music to the puzzles – combining to put emphasis on the setting and mood. It is even a good ‘bang for your buck’ purchase as it offers you around 10 to 12 hours of squirting entertainment, which would usually cost you way more if you were looking for squirting entertainment on the internet. Hell, I was so engrossed in it I pretty much sat down and played the whole thing in a single sitting.\nI really have to pee.\nHere’s the Rundown:\n+ Well paced and intelligently designed puzzles with incredibly well done physics\n+ Great to look at and listen to\n+ Long for an indie game, and well worth the money\n- Lack of hints or overt direction could turn off some gamers\n- Occasional technical issues, including a save bug that is in need of a patch\n- Some puzzles can become frustrating due to hiccups with the fluros\n8 and 8.5 represent a game that is a good experience overall. While there may be some issues that prevent it from being fantastic, these scores are for games that you feel would easily be worth a purchase.\nVessel was developed by Strange Loop games and published by Indie Loop for the PC, and eventually for the XBLA and PSN . The game was released on March 1, 2012 with an MSRP of $14.99 on the PC. XBLA and PSN release dates have not been confirmed yet. The game was purchased by my main squeeze because she is a goth chick and thus immediately attracted to anything steampunk. It was played for around ten hours until completion. Specs of the PC used are as follows: Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550 @ 2.83ghz, Nvidia Geforce 570 GTX GPU, 8GB RAM, and Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit.

{"doc": {"text": "Barbara Ehrenreich – a Situationist\nPosted by The Situationist Staff on October 14, 2009\nFrom a related Time Magazine article here’s a brief sample of her writing on the topic of optimism.\n* * *\nIf you’re craving a quick hit of optimism, reading a news magazine is probably not the best way to go about finding it. As the life coaches and motivational speakers have been trying to tell us for more than a decade now, a healthy, positive mental outlook requires strict abstinence from current events in all forms. Instead, you should patronize sites like Happynews.com, where the top international stories of the week include “Jobless Man Finds Buried Treasure” and “Adorable ‘Teacup Pigs’ Are Latest Hit with Brits.”\nOr of course you can train yourself to be optimistic through sheer mental discipline. Ever since psychologist Martin Seligman crafted the phrase “learned optimism” in 1991 and started offering optimism training, there’s been a thriving industry in the kind of thought reform that supposedly overcomes negative thinking. You can buy any number of books and DVDs with titles like Little Gold Book of YES! Attitude, in which you will learn mental exercises to reprogram your outlook from gray to the rosiest pink: “affirmations,” for example, in which you repeat upbeat predictions over and over to yourself; “visualizations” in which you post on your bathroom mirror pictures of that car or boat you want; “disputations” to refute any stray negative thoughts that may come along. If money is no object, you can undergo a three-month “happiness makeover” from a life coach or invest $3,575 for three days of “optimism training” on a Good Mood Safari on the coast of New South Wales. . . .\n* * *\nAmericans have long prided themselves on being “positive” and optimistic — traits that reached a manic zenith in the early years of this millennium. Iraq would be a cakewalk! The Dow would reach 36,000! Housing prices could never decline! Optimism was not only patriotic, it was a Christian virtue, or so we learned from the proliferating preachers of the “prosperity gospel,” whose God wants to “prosper” you. In 2006, the runaway bestseller The Secret promised that you could have anything you wanted, anything at all, simply by using your mental powers to “attract” it. The poor listened to upbeat preachers like Joel Osteen and took out subprime mortgages. The rich paid for seminars led by motivational speakers like Tony Robbins and repackaged those mortgages into securities sold around the world. . . .\n* * *\nBelow are some excerpts from the introduction of her new book explaining that, optimism notwithstanding, Americans are not necessarily better off.\n* * *\nSurprisingly, when psychologists undertake to measure the relative happiness of nations, they routinely find that Americans are not, even in prosperous times and despite our vaunted positivity, very happy at all. A recent meta-analysis of over a hundred studies of self-reported happiness worldwide found Americans ranking only twenty-third, surpassed by the Dutch, the Danes, the Malaysians, the Bahamians, the Austrians, and even the supposedly dour Finns. In another potential sign of relative distress, Americans account for two-thirds of the global market for antidepressants, which happen also to be the most commonly prescribed drugs in the United States. To my knowledge, no one knows how antidepressant use affects people’s responses to happiness surveys: do respondents report being happy because the drugs make them feel happy or do they report being unhappy because they know they are dependent on drugs to make them feel better? Without our heavy use of antidepressants, Americans would likely rank far lower in the happiness rankings than we currently do.\nWhen economists attempt to rank nations more objectively in terms of “well-being,” taking into account such factors as health, environmental sustainability, and the possibility of upward mobility, the United States does even more poorly than it does when only the subjective state of “happiness” is measured. The Happy Planet Index, to give just one example, locates us at 150th among the world’s nations.\n* * *\nBut of course it takes the effort of positive thinking to imagine that America is the “best” or the “greatest.” Militarily, yes, we are the mightiest nation on earth. But on many other fronts, the American score is dismal, and was dismal even before the economic downturn that began in 2007. Our children routinely turn out to be more ignorant of basic subjects like math and geography than their counterparts in other industrialized nations. They are also more likely to die in infancy or grow up in poverty. Almost everyone acknowledges that our health care system is “broken” and our physical infrastructure crumbling. We have lost so much of our edge in science and technology that American companies have even begun to outsource their research and development efforts. Worse, some of the measures by which we do lead the world should inspire embarrassment rather than pride: We have the highest percentage of our population incarcerated, and the greatest level of inequality in wealth and income. We are plagued by gun violence and racked by personal debt.\nWhile positive thinking has reinforced and found reinforcement in American national pride, it has also entered into a kind of symbiotic relationship with American capitalism. There is no natural, innate affinity between capitalism and positive thinking. In fact, one of the classics of sociology, Max Weber’s Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, makes a still impressive case for capitalism’s roots in the grim and punitive outlook of Calvinist Protestantism, which required people to defer gratification and resist all pleasurable temptations in favor of hard work and the accumulation of wealth.\nBut if early capitalism was inhospitable to positive thinking, “late” capitalism, or consumer capitalism, is far more congenial, depending as it does on the individual’s hunger for more and the firm’s imperative of growth. The consumer culture encourages individuals to want more — cars, larger homes, television sets, cell phones, gadgets of all kinds — and positive thinking is ready at hand to tell them they deserve more and can have it if they really want it and are willing to make the effort to get it. Meanwhile, in a competitive business world, the companies that manufacture these goods and provide the paychecks that purchase them have no alternative but to grow. If you don’t steadily increase market share and profits, you risk being driven out of business or swallowed by a larger enterprise. Perpetual growth, whether of a particular company or an entire economy, is of course an absurdity, but positive thinking makes it seem possible, if not ordained.\nIn addition, positive thinking has made itself useful as an apology for the crueler aspects of the market economy. If optimism is the key to material success, and if you can achieve an optimistic outlook through the discipline of positive thinking, then there is no excuse for failure. The flip side of positivity is thus a harsh insistence on personal responsibility: if your business fails or your job is eliminated, it must because you didn’t try hard enough, didn’t believe firmly enough in the inevitability of your success. As the economy has brought more layoffs and financial turbulence to the middle class, the promoters of positive thinking have increasingly emphasized this negative judgment: to be disappointed, resentful, or downcast is to be a “victim” and a “whiner.”\n* * *\nFor a sample of related Situationist posts, see “Self-Serving Biases,” “The Motivated Situation of Inequality and Discrimination,” “Thanksgiving as “System Justification”?,” “Cheering for the Underdog,” “Ayn Rand’s Dispositionism: The Situation of Ideas,” “Deep Capture – Part X,” “Promoting Dispositionism through Entertainment – Part I, Part II, & Part III,” “The Unconscious Situation of our Consciousness – Part IV,” and “The (Unconscious) Situation of our Consciousness – Part III.”", "id": "<urn:uuid:7b746535-6e89-4641-9542-731a8b3bd10e>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://thesituationist.wordpress.com/2009/10/14/barbara-ehrenreich-a-situationist/", "date": "2013-05-22T07:40:14Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368701459211/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516105059-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9452835321426392, "token_count": 1754}, "content": [{"line": "Barbara Ehrenreich – a Situationist", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Posted by The Situationist Staff on October 14, 2009", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "From a related Time Magazine article here’s a brief sample of her writing on the topic of optimism.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "* * *", "label": "Formatting, Style, and Errors", "split": false}, {"line": "If you’re craving a quick hit of optimism, reading a news magazine is probably not the best way to go about finding it.

{"doc": {"text": "LISBON, Mar 22 (IPS) - The huge impact of the economic crisis on male employment in Portugal has led to a sharp increase in the proportion of women who have become the main breadwinners in their families. But that has not translated into progress towards equality.\n\"Today there is more male unemployment than female, because the crisis has especially affected the civil construction industry,\" said Anália Torres, a professor at the Technical University of Lisbon's Higher Institute of Social and Political Sciences.\n\"With less economic activity in that industry, which traditionally employs men, the male unemployment rate has climbed, while in sectors that generally employ women, unemployment grew much less,\" Torres said in an interview with IPS.\nThe European Commission expects unemployment in Portugal to reach 17.3 percent in 2013. But opposition parties and trade unions project a rate of 24 percent.\nProfessor Anália Torres at the Technical University of Lisbon's Higher Institute of Social and Political Sciences. Credit: Mario Queiroz/IPS\nThe gap between the figures is explained by the thousands of people who have stopped registering at the government employment centres or have moved abroad, mainly to other European countries or to the former Portuguese colonies of Brazil, Angola, Mozambique or Macau.\nAmong those who only have a primary school education, \"the woman always earns less than the man,\" Torres said. \"And as the educational level increases, the difference between the incomes of men and women grows. A woman with a doctorate earns much less than a man (with the same degree).\"\nIn areas like education and health, where women earn 20 percent less than men, it is men who are most often laid off \"because they are more expensive.\"\nAnother factor that puts women in the position of bringing home the bacon \"is that many remunerated activities carried out by women are in the informal economy, undeclared or unskilled work, such as cleaning or babysitting in the homes of the well-off,\" the academic said.\nIn Portugal, the 1961-1974 colonial war in the country's overseas territories in Africa – Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique – \"led to large numbers of women replacing men (in the workplace),\" Torres said.\nSince then, \"the idea of the working woman who helps support her family has remained in place,\" she added.\nDuring the war, Portugal maintained a permanent force of 220,000 military troops – an enormous figure compared to a population at the time of 8.8 million (10.6 million today).\nIn the 1960s, one million people from Portugal moved abroad for economic reasons or to avoid being sent to war in Africa. Women, Torres said, \"took on a central role in a country with very few men of working age.\"\nNevertheless, \"the predominant sexism persisted, and men continue to make a show of unacceptable machismo today,\" she said.\n\"By refusing to help do things around the home on the argument that ‘I am a man, I don't do that kind of work', which also causes serious domestic violence problems, men show that the sexist culture is still in place.\"\nWomen are sometimes the target of violence, often with tragic results, because many men \"base their masculinity on their wage-earning power, even though both men and women have been working and supporting the family for a long time now in Portugal,\" Torres added.\nBetween January and November 2012, 30 women were killed in Portugal by their partners or ex-partners, according to UMAR, one of the largest women's organisations in the country.\nThat makes Portugal the country with the largest number of femicides – gender-related murders – in the European Union, in proportion to the population.\nBut \"working is also a kind of insurance against machismo, in the sense of women being aware that they are making a living and don't need men,\" Torres said.\nSociologist and researcher Sofia Aboim of the University of Lisbon's Institute of Social Sciences said that in the last eight years, the proportion of couples in which the woman is the main breadwinner has risen from two to 16.5 percent.\nIt is \"obvious\" that many men \"have suffered a strong blow to their self-esteem, because their masculinity is traditionally associated closely with supporting the family,\" she wrote in the newspaper Público about the conclusions of a study on the subject.\nAboim said this situation was seen especially in couples with low levels of education and in older couples, especially between the ages of 51 and 65.\nBut Torres said discrimination against women is also deeply rooted among more educated segments of the population, even though \"there are many women with excellent educations - teachers and professors, for instance.\"\nIn general, \"the highest-level posts are filled by men, even though, for example in the academic world, studies show that there is no difference in the production of research or articles. But women are not heads of institutes and are not on the boards of universities, with very few exceptions,\" she said.\nOne big exception is the Centre for Judicial Studies, which provides training for future judges and prosecutors. Because the centre accepts lawyers on the basis of competitive examinations, \"80 percent of those who have been accepted for training as magistrates in the last decade were women, because they scored higher than men.\"\nThe problems plaguing Portugal affect everyone, \"but in the crisis, women face greater difficulties, aggravated in cases in which their husbands are unemployed, because they still have to take everything on their shoulders.\n\"The worst thing about this government (of conservative Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho) is its complete insensitivity and indifference towards the plight of the people,\" Torres said.\nThis is especially serious in Portugal and other countries where sexism is predominant, she said, because \"if a woman has work and her partner does not, she continues to do the housework, unlike what occurs in other places, where men participate in the housework when they are unemployed.\"\n© Inter Press Service (2013) — All Rights ReservedOriginal source: Inter Press Service\nLatest News Headlines\nRead the latest news stories:\n- U.S. Strategy on Water, Development a “Major Advance” Wednesday, May 22, 2013\n- Stressed Ecosystems Leaving Humanity High and Dry Tuesday, May 21, 2013\n- Organic Cooperative Proves that Agriculture Can Prosper in Cuba Tuesday, May 21, 2013\n- Indigenous Brazilians Learn to Fight for the Right to Food Tuesday, May 21, 2013\n- Seeking Justice for Dictatorship Victims – Two Continents Apart Tuesday, May 21, 2013\n- Tackling Crime Takes on Import As Urban Populations Rise Tuesday, May 21, 2013\n- Q&A: Guantanamo 'Has No Right to Exist' Tuesday, May 21, 2013\n- UNFPA Focuses on Contraception for 222 Million in Developing World Tuesday, May 21, 2013\n- Caribbean Farming Gets Its Roots Wet Tuesday, May 21, 2013\n- Zimbabwe’s Ruling Party Militias Spread Fear of Voting Tuesday, May 21, 2013", "id": "<urn:uuid:e46b7456-a101-498d-9ec0-20465d5c0352>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.globalissues.org/news/2013/03/22/16153", "date": "2013-05-22T07:12:50Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368701459211/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516105059-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9681819677352905, "token_count": 1466}, "content": [{"line": "LISBON, Mar 22 (IPS) - The huge impact of the economic crisis on male employment in Portugal has led to a sharp increase in the proportion of women who have become the main breadwinners in their families.

Baker spent the last two years as superintendent of Cooper's Rock State Park near Morgantown and spent the five years prior to that as assistant superintendent at Blennerhassett Island.\nFrom his own experiences, Baker believes increases in fuel costs have actually brought about increases in attendance and usage at the local state parks.\nIn both locations over the past four years, he said he saw fewer out-of-state visitors making use of the parks, but that was offset by an increased usage by in-state residents and those who live in the immediate region.\nBaker believes the \"stay-cation\" trend of the last several years is continuing.\n\"Not only are state parks close to home, they offer very economical activities,\" he said, citing camping as the most common example.\nIn his last two years at Cooper's Rock, which offers camping, Baker said he saw a lot of return visitors, but also saw a lot of new people who have turned away from long-distance vacations to see what is available in their home territory and are giving it a try.\nTeresa Turner, executive director of the Belpre Area Chamber of Commerce which organizes the Belpre Homecoming Festival, said she has been finding that people aren't traveling as far, so they are more interested in finding out what is available to do within their local communities and regions.\n\"We haven't really noticed anything being down due to gas prices,\" she said.\nThis year's Belpre Homecoming will be Aug. 2-4 at Civitan Park in Belpre. Turner said attendance has remained positive for the event, even when the economic downturn was at its worst locally about three years ago.

I really am liking the vibe. Not only do we have clean and functional rooms, but we are getting for well under $30 for private rooms. If you are willing to do the dorm thing, most are in the $7 to $15 dollars a night range. Best of all however are the locations and the facilities. In Leon it was all about location, patio and pool. Here it is the garden, hammocks and ocean waves. Yes, we change the age curve, but who cares!

{"doc": {"text": "Blogger: Steve Rowland, Public Affairs Manager\nSpring seemed a long way off last week as I took my lunchtime walk through the woods, the leaves on the trees were yet to unfurl, the ground was bare and covered in a mulch of last autumns dead leaves, and a light, cold wintry rain drizzled down.\nAnd yet I realised that my mind had picked up on the subtle changes in the quality of light and drawing out of the days. I became aware of a slight tightness in my ears, an unconscious straining and heightened alertness to the bird song around me. And I thought that after more Springs as a birder than I care to remember, my brain was quietly and unobtrusively saying to my ears to be alert for couple of unremarkable notes of bird song one up followed repetitively by another down, up and down in short bursts, from a bird that takes its name from these two notes of song, the chiff chaff. (photo below).\nNaming a bird after the sound it makes is known as onomatopoeia and two other species that occur in the UK the cuckoo and the kittiwake also take their names from their calls.\nI will acknowledge here that chiff chaffs are not blessed with the most captivating of names or musical of songs. But for me they compensate for that with the charisma that comes from being the first of our returning migrants to fill our bare Spring woods with their song, perhaps a month before the other returning warblers have got back from a winter spent south of the Sahara.\nChiff chaffs like many of our other warblers, might at a glance appear a little drab and indistinct. In particular at first you might easily confuse a chiff chaff with its close relative the willow warbler. (photo below).\nA rough guide to telling them apart is that a willow warblers legs are a light flesh colour whilst a chiff chaffs are black and a chiff chaffs has a more olive coloured plumage (being a birder you carry a veritable colour palette in your head to describe shades of green and brown feathers).\nBut the surest way to tell these cousins apart is to listen to them singing. Compared to the chiff chaffs repetitive two notes, willow warblers have a to my mind a much nicer song, a lovely tinkling sound that seems to gently descend a set of musical scales before being hauled by the bird back to the top only to descend down them once more.\nWillow warblers arrive from their wintering grounds in Africa a little later in the spring than chiff chaffs which tend to spend the winter in the Mediterranean. So my brain wasn't tipping my ears off to listen out for a willow warbler practicing its scales, but for that starting gun of the season, a simple two note Chiff then Chaff song that would light up the woods and put a smile on my face, a sign of the end of winter and the beginning of natures headlong rush into spring.\nI didn’t hear a chiff chaff last week but I’ll be out again for a lunchtime walk in the woods this week, listening carefully for those two notes. If you have some time to spare over the next week or so why don’t you go out and see if you can hear a chiff chaff and then tell us here.\nPhotos credit John Bridges (rspb-images.com)\nBlogger: Kate Blincoe, Communications Manager\nLook out of your window. The catkins are swaying in the spring breeze, the blue tit is hunting out caterpillars for its young family and an early bumblebee buzzes by. Nature is busy all around us.\nWhat if pound signs were flashing over all these beautiful, natural events? If you look on these living things as paid workers for us then the catkins tree is capturing carbon, the blue tit is performing pest control on your garden and the bumblebee is a professional pollinator. All these creatures are in fact performing tiny actions that in sum, add up to a healthy environment and hence healthy economy. In simple terms, if they didn’t do it for free, we’d have to pay to find a technical replacement.\nLet’s look at some of the massive ways in which we benefit financially from nature. Carefully managed wetlands reduce the risk of flooding to our homes and businesses. Salt marshes, such wonderful habitats, provide protection from sea level rise, acting like big sponges. Forests and peat bogs store carbon for us, helping in the battle against climate change.\nThe list doesn’t end there: It is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on insect pollination, most of which is accomplished by bees pollinating crops. Of course, beautiful places with charismatic wildlife also equal booming tourism and lots of visitor spend – especially in our stunning region.\nWhat about you and me and a walk together in the bluebell woods? Does that have pound signs attached to it? Yes. It will reduce our stress levels, increase our heart rates and hence improve our health. It’s a proven fact that nature is good news for the NHS budgets. For children, time spent in nature can even improve their behaviour and performance at school.\nAs a bit of a nature loving ‘tree hugger’, a part of me screams at this reduction of wonder and marvel to pounds and pennies. Wildlife means so much more than that and has a basic, intrinsic right to exist. I believe that is the case, however, when so many political arguments are made in financial terms, it doesn’t do us any harm to be able to speak that language too.\nIn a troubled economy, the need for a new development or construction project is often justified by saying growth is critical for our financial future. However, if we trash our special habitats and lose incredible species then, even in crude monetary terms, we risk jeopardising so much more than we gain. We overlook the function that the environment plays in our economy at our peril.\nThe bottom line is this: We need nature more than it needs us.\nArticle in Eastern Daily Press on Saturday 10 March 2012.\nPhoto by Mark Sisson (rspb-images.com)\nBlogger: Jane Warren, RSPB in the East Green Team\nAs we edge along towards spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it’s worth sparing a thought for the climate. Today is the beginning of Climate Change Week (12-18 March), and there are easy ways for us all to get involved. Many of us are already doing our bit, but it’s always good to be reminded! So here are three things to do this week:\nGet cooking with Climate Week cuisine: Make food part of the solution to climate change by eating a low carbon meal during Climate Week. Just follow one or all of these three tips: eat less meat or dairy, eat local and seasonal ingredients, and eat leftovers.\nWalk, cycle or use public transport: Use Climate Week as an opportunity to use more sustainable ways to get to where you are going. Take the train or bus instead of driving. Take advantage of the spring weather (!) and walk or cycle, getting some additional exercise!\nSwap, recycle or upcycle old things: Eliminate waste by finding a second life for things that would otherwise be thrown away. Host an event to swap unwanted items, such as books, toys or clothes, with friends or colleagues. Recycle unusual things like batteries, or electrical goods such as old mobile phones.\nYou can even recycle through Ebay, by taking up the RSPB’s Ebay for charity challenge. Do you have something lurking in a loft, back room, garage or shed? Something that you know has some saleable value but you have never got around to selling? This could be your chance to do just that and step up for nature at the same time! Please do get in touch with suggestions of what you might have to sell, and we can check if it is worth us getting our fabulous Ebay volunteers to sell it on the auction site for us. Please do not send anything to us without checking first and please note that we can’t accept electrical goods! (It’s worth repeating that so that our collector Matt Howard isn’t locked in the cellar as punishment along with the potential deluge of books, CDs, DVDs, autographed Barry Manilow LPs etc.) Matt is looking forward to hearing from you at email@example.com Tel: 01603 697515.\nOur thanks to Climate Week for ideas and tips. Check out their website at www.climateweek.com and get inspired to create a sustainable future!\nBlogger: Gena Correale-Wardle, Community Fundraising Officer\nDo you remember in January when I blogged about the great partnership the RSPB had with Dozen Artisan Bakery and Pulse Cafe Bar, two great independent eateries in Norwich? I bet you’ve been waiting with baited breath to see how we got on....\nWell, today I went to see the lovely manager of Pulse, Helen, as she presented us with a great big cheque (literally – see the photo!) for £86.50. That equates to 173 starters, mains and desserts eaten in aid of the RSPB. Dozen Artisan Bakery sold their field loaves for nature too – another £91 and 91 satisfied tummies and smiles on faces! Wouldn’t it be nice if all fundraising could be that easy?!\nThe lovely people at both outlets also hosted pin badge boxes and gave out lots of leaflets to promote Big Garden Birdwatch, raising awareness of the project as well as raising even more money (over £40) through pin badge donations. A win-win all round!\nWe are really glad to work with such great local, independent businesses in the area and hope we can do more with them in future. We are always looking for ways to get businesses involved throughout the whole of the Eastern England region so if you have any links or want to promote your business and raise money for nature in the process, do get in touch!\nThe money raised will help the RSPB save and protect wildlife supporting schools and families through field teaching programmes and schools visits as well as directly managing habitats for wildlife at our amazing nature reserves.\nThank you to all of you who ate great food and saved nature at the same time. Here’s to more fab little initiatives like this in the future!

The island was a perfect tonic as there were no modern day distractions that seem to fill our free time usually. This meant that we had an excuse of not doing very much at all – just what I needed after the crazy hustle bustle of the RSPB Eastern Region office in Norwich.\nEach day we would spend many hours in wellies walking the island. In the interior we spotted dancing flocks of skylarks, eyeing foxes in the distance and then the adventurers inside us would walk alongside the beaches and salt marshes to circumnavigate our little piece of Essex. If we were lucky enough to get the tides right we would see vast numbers of birds coming into feed or queuing up ready for the seafood frenzy. The rest of my family were happy to spot a “funny looking goose” or distinctive oyster catcher with their carrot beaks. I on the other hand, trained zoologist and bitten by the RSPB bug, realised that I wasn’t just seeing a few species of animals out there on the mud flats but dozens – all ever so slightly different. However, this is my question to you – how on earth are you supposed to tell the difference? I am now going to give it a go. The keen ones amongst you, feel free to correct me, I won’t take it personally ;)\nDunlin: Little fella, grey wings, white belly, slightly curved beak\nTurnstone: Little, black wings, white belly, red legs\nCommon sandpiper: brown body, straight beak, black eye stripe\nCurlew sandpiper: if you squidged the two sandpipers together\nGreen sandpiper: dark, white bellied sandpiper that is not green\nGrey plover: a more speckly version of a turnstone\nCurlew: This one I get, bendy beak and big as a chicken!\nRedshank: Medium sized, red legs and red beak near face\nSpotted redshank: red legs, black top beak, red lower beak\nSo, can you see why I was confused. It doesn't help that when I was reading the information on my RSPB i-phone app it told me that these are the winter plumages of these birds - so as new species come in for the summer I will have to learn this all over again. I did however figure out that the bird call I has associated with the wilds of southern Ireland ( a previous family holiday) was not the charismatic oyster catcher but the close neighbours the curlew.\nI guess the beauty of this whole thing is now, once I get my eye in, I realise how many different species find the eerie and beautiful Essex coast a perfect tonic, just what they need.", "id": "<urn:uuid:8f4b98cc-b9b6-4f03-bdfe-20c3e3a71278>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.rspb.org.uk/community/ourwork/b/east/archive/2012/03.aspx?PageIndex=2", "date": "2013-05-22T07:37:03Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368701459211/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516105059-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9571710824966431, "token_count": 2921}, "content": [{"line": "Blogger: Steve Rowland, Public Affairs Manager", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Spring seemed a long way off last week as I took my lunchtime walk through the woods, the leaves on the trees were yet to unfurl, the ground was bare and covered in a mulch of last autumns dead leaves, and a light, cold wintry rain drizzled down.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "And yet I realised that my mind had picked up on the subtle changes in the quality of light and drawing out of the days.

{"doc": {"text": "Companies do sometime make bad decisions. One of the worse bad decision it might bet the company on something that did not pay off. It is part of the risk companies take.\nHowever, when it involves selling off part of the business that you are famous and in the lead for because it is dull and to pursue more sexy business that the company is not in the lead, that will not be sound decision. One knows one is doing it if there is a lot of opposition or surprise when one announces the decision. I call this selling off the crown jewels.\nSo far, of the three examples I heard of in the tech industry, two failed, and one is not doing as well as it would.\nThe first example is Marconi. It decided to sell its defense and wireless equipment business to concentrate on the telecommunication business. That was made at the height of dot-com boom and almost tanked the company when it burst.\nToday we have the second example in HP. When one thinks of HP, one thinks of its test equipment business mainly, followed by electronic parts business. Computers? Not in a million years. When Fiorina tried to sell off the crown jewel to concentrate on computers. That shocked a lot of people. It met opposition from at least one descendent of the company’s founder. Unfortunately for HP, it happened. Today, we heard that it is throwing away the computer business to concentrate on the IT business. That’s a sad situation for a company that sold its crown jewel. Probably the only lucky thing is the spin out company that got HP’s crown jewels, Agilent Technology, is still a leader in the field.\nThe example that is not doing that well is Motorola. It’s well known for its semiconductor business. Telecommunication equipment? We know it exists but a world leader? No. After the spin off the business to Freescale Semiconductor to concentrate on telecommunication, Motorola’s finances were up and down. Unlike Marconi or HP, at least it has its high moment when Motorola Razr was the rage and the spinning off of its crown jewels looks like it might be paying off.

There'll be marches, parades, testimonials, candlelight precessions, and moments of silence. There'll be fireworks and stirring patriotic songs.

There are church memorials planed, Jewish memorials, Islamic memorials, even atheist memorials. Homosexual, lesbian and transgenered activities will be held to honor those homosexual, lesbian and transgenered victims of 9-11.\nCelebrities will be doing more specials to honor the victims and the victims' families. Music videos, symphony orchestras, poetry readings and sing-a-longs. There will be even more money collected for the families of the victims (when will there be enough, already?). We will see photos of the victims again. Hear their tragic stories again. We will remember the heroes and honor them again. People will cry again.

Yes, we have remembered Pearl Harbor on December 7th for decades, but we never embraced it to the extent that we embrace anniversaries of \"death days\" now. Thanks in part to television, we have become a society that wallows in it's tragedies. Even good intentions can be overdone.\nMeanwhile, we get closer to expanding our war on the Islamic terrorists that attacked us one year ago. Vice President Cheney has made it clear that the administration is preparing to liberate Iraq and take out Saddam Hussein. It's about time. In order to destroy terrorist networks like al Qaeda we need to overthrow the regimes that support them. As long as there are terrorist states like Iraq, Iran and Syria -- governments that harbor, train, and encourage terrorists -- we can never expect to completely succeed in our war against terror. The terrorists need to live somewhere -- we must do what is necessary to severely limit their housing options.\nIf we really want to honor the memory of those who were incinerated last year we need to do something truly spectacular -- something that not only shows proper respect for their lives, but also sends a message to the world that all of America has taken their deaths extremely personally. Yes, we need to do something spectacular.\nDo we sing patriotic songs? Do we shoot off fireworks? Do we wave millions of American flags? Do we light 3,000 candles? Do we release 3,000 doves? Do we walk outside and hold hands with our neighbors? Do we weep collectively along with the victims' families?

We've heard the stories of horror and heroism. We've praised the firemen, the police, the military. We've given money to help the victims. We've gotten mad at the terrorists.

{"doc": {"text": "So first, my apologies for taking a month to write another post. The end of February was filled with craziness (read: my 32nd birthday) and March got off to a smashing start when I managed to slice my thumb open with a dull boxcutter blade and ended up in the hospital getting stitches. Plus there’s been basketball, and as a University of Kansas alum, it’s something akin to a religious experience.\nThat said, I got the stitches out today, so I popped a bottle of wine when I got home. Here’s what I’m sipping right now:\nRegion: Monterey County, CA\nGrapes involved: Merlot, Cab Sauv and Syrah\nFood pairings: The first thing that comes to mind is a turkey sandwich. You’ll see why. Otherwise, go for something that would work with a slightly sweeter red (*not* a *sweet* red, but an off-dry-ish red), like brie covered in berries or something. Plus, I’ve got this sort of obsession with any kind of Syrah blend and a hunk of fresh mozzarella. I don’t know, it’s just lovely.\nThe wine, if it isn’t apparent in the photo, is a nifty pretty sort of mulberry color, bright and rich and jewel toned. It smells like cherries, carnations, a hint of pepper and lots of berries. It’s a fairly fruit-forward scent - not the raspberry jam bomb of a lot of Zins, but still pretty fruity.\nTasting it, I get cranberry jelly. Absolute, total, no-questions-asked cranberry jelly. Hence the desire to put this with a turkey sandwich: my first few sips made me think of Thanksgiving like woah.* It’s got all the components: tons and tons of bright, tart, very red berry, a hint of clove and allspice, the barest hint of cinnamon, something reminiscent of orange peel. It’s backed up by a hint of vanilla (read: oak), a touch of rose petal and a bit of strawberry and red raspberry. The mouthfeel is soft and luscious and medium-bodied.\nSo this is pretty much the consummate red blend that’s uber-popular right now. It’s bright and fruit-forward, slightly (but not overly) sweet, has very soft tannins, and is possessed of the requisite (sorry, y’all) annoying name.**\n*I missed Thanksgiving last year due to a badly-timed massive stomach bug, the details of which I won’t share here. So thinking of Thanksgiving makes me alternately really happy (because it’s my favorite holiday ever) and slightly sad (because I missed stuffing my facehole with stuffing last year and I still have 8 months to wait before the next Thanksgiving facehole-stuffing extravaganza).\n**I’m not kidding. Red Blends have some positively nonsensical names: Apothic, Hey Mambo, Rex Goliath Free Range Red, and (I wish I were kidding) Yellowtail Sweet Red Roo (y’all, my head about exploded. That said, the label resembles a bright red disco ball, and I am totally on board with that). I never thought I’d love Blackstone for anything, but the fact that they’ve named their red blend nothing more than “Red Blend” makes me adore them right now.", "id": "<urn:uuid:9d7a7d30-c316-4a92-aeee-64efff8c88db>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://kimandtonic.com/2012/03/", "date": "2013-05-24T15:35:43Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368704713110/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516114513-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9164107441902161, "token_count": 750}, "content": [{"line": "So first, my apologies for taking a month to write another post.

The texture is more like \"real\" mincemeat, which is how my family refers to mincemeat with meat in it. I found the recipe difficult to figure out, as per my earlier posting. Weight for the tomatoes and apples would have been much more helpful. I had no idea how many to use. In the end, I went with what my soup pot could hold. I used 3 kilos of tomatoes and 3 kilos of apples. I cut everything else in half except the raisins. I used all the raisins. When I saw how full it was at that point, I cannot imagine what size pot one would need for twice as many apples and tomatoes. I also added about 1/2 lb currants and 1 lb each of red cherries and green cherries. We'll see how it bakes up in tarts or muffins. If I have any further tips after I do that, I will post again.\nThis is just like my mother's recipe which I lost! Thank you for posting so I can make mince again. I use butter instead of suet. Great way to use up green tomatoes!\nWhat a great recipe! I had an abundance of green tomatoes and didn't want to fry all of them or let them go to waste. I love mincemeat pie and will love giving jars of mincemeat for Christmas. I scaled it back to 40 servings, and used all of the ingredients called for. I sampled it before I canned and am anxious to make a pie come Thanksgiving or Christmas. It may need a little thickening before putting in a pie as filling.\nThis is a great recipe for using up the last of your tomatoes that won't ripen by the end of the gardening season. It is great as a pie filling but we like it as a pancake, waffle,or ice cream topping too. ******You don't HAVE to add the suet to this recipe and it is still great.****** I am not opposed to adding suet,it is just my personal choice and it keeps the recipe vegan friendly.\nThis is great stuff. I adjusted the recipe to the amount of my tomatoes for a total yield of 13 pints. Chose to use butter rather than suet. I made this 6 weeks ago and have made two pies with it in the last week (testing for the holidays). For a more traditional flavor, added a shot of brandy to the second pie. Again, this is great stuff. Thanks!\nMy tomato plants got caught by the frost, and I was left with \"tons\". I used the calculator to cut it in half and got 14 pint jars. I used the suet, and added a lb. of currants.I was very, very pleased with the flavour and plan on giving some away for Xmas gifts. I have a meat grinder, and put everything through the meat chopper using a 3/8\" blade. It was perfect. I boiled it the 3 hrs. and then processed in a boiling water bath. Don't be afraid to try it!\nWow! I made this yesterday omitting the suet and candied fruit, since neither was readily available. Instead, I added a bit of fresh ginger and some orange peel granules I found at our coop.\nThen today, I tried it out on a pie. I was concerned it was a bit runny, so I added 2 T of tapioca, a diced apple and a handful of raisins. I have made pies all of my life, and I truly think this is my favorite.

{"doc": {"text": "After speaking with Matt Kenseth via phone on Wednesday afternoon, I feel like I have a better grasp on why he made the decision to leave Roush Fenway Racing for a yet-to-be-named team (likely Joe Gibbs Racing).\nWhile Kenseth can't or won't say everything that led to his decision, he was very forthcoming about the details he felt he could talk about.\nHere are some common questions from you and a few answers that might help you understand the move:\nKenseth doesn't have a full-time sponsor at Roush this year and might not have had one next year. Was stability the reason he left?\nThe stability of just having a job and staying in the sport ranks \"almost on the bottom\" of his priority list, Kenseth said.\n\"Winning races and trying to race for championships is on the top of my list, because you never know how long you can do this stuff,\" the 40-year-old said. \"You never know when your last race is or your last lap is or your last win is or any of that.\"\nReading between the lines on everything that's happened, it seems like the decision to leave was Kenseth's -- though it certainly doesn't hurt Roush to move one of its younger, cheaper drivers in Ricky Stenhouse Jr. up the ladder into the Sprint Cup Series.\nIf Kenseth is having such a solid year and leading the points, why did he go looking for another team?\nHe didn't. Other teams knew Kenseth was a free agent who was unsigned past this season, and the driver said he was approached by one who had an opportunity that intrigued him. As recently as a month or two ago, Kenseth planned on being at Roush for his entire career -- just as team owner Jack Roush said he did.\nWhen he got the initial phone call expressing interest, Kenseth said he didn't think, \"Yeah, that's what I'm going to do for sure.\"\n\"But after some talking and getting to know some people and some things that were happening, I think it just felt like it was the right thing to do,\" he said. \"You look back and you're like, 'Oh man, I hope this is right.' But I felt really strongly it was the right thing to do and that was the place for me and the time to go do that. And I still feel like that.\"\nWas there a behind-the-scenes argument at Roush that we don't know about?\nNot according to Kenseth, who said he knows the lack of \"one great reason\" makes it harder for reporters and fans to understand his decision.\n\"It's a combination of a lot of things and timing,\" he said. \"There's nobody that was mad. There wasn't a fight, there wasn't a disagreement or somebody not doing something. There wasn't really any of that. I know that doesn't sound like a good answer, but that's really the truth.\"\nKenseth said there was \"no resistance from anywhere,\" and that it felt like all the pieces just fell into place for his move to happen. It certainly helped Kenseth to know Roush wanted to get Stenhouse Jr. into a Cup car.\n\"I really think things happen for a reason and things line up like that sometimes,\" he said. \"When they do, that's how it was meant to go – and that's what happened here.\"\nOK, but this is all about the money, right?\nKenseth has always been sensitive about his contract situation and won't discuss financial details. And this year, it's worth noting, Kenseth wouldn't even publicly acknowledge his free agent status.\nIf he was going for a big payday, he perhaps could have used the media to gain leverage -- either with Roush or potential suitors -- but instead, he kept quiet about it the whole time.\nSources told SB Nation that Kenseth might actually be taking a pay cut with his new team rather than scoring a bigger deal. If he'd remained at Roush, though, he may have gotten even less due to the sponsorship situation there.\nRoush will save millions per year by signing Stenhouse Jr. instead of Kenseth, which will lower the price point for sponsorship.\nWhy can't Kenseth and his new team (again, likely JGR) just announce their deal now? Are there sponsorship concerns still to be worked out?\nKenseth said he simply couldn't talk about the details of where he's headed in 2013, even the reasons why an announcement can't be made yet. He said the news will be made public \"hopefully sooner than later\" and all sides had already reached an agreement, including his new sponsors.\n\"Everything is set; everything is in place,\" he said. \"I think we're good there. I feel good about '13 and beyond. I don't think it's any of that.\"\nThe driver said his new team -- which he called \"another very winning organization\" -- is a good fit for him and he believes he can be successful there.\nIsn't Kenseth getting kind of old to start over with a new team?\nNot at all. Though Kenseth is 40, that's not old for a race car driver. Tony Stewart just won the championship at 40 last year, and Mark Martin is still racing competitively at age 53.\nKenseth said Wednesday it's impossible to say right now how much longer he plans to race.\n\"I just don't know,\" he said. \"And by saying 'I don't know,' I feel like that means I'm so far away from the end or when I want to walk away that I can't even fathom when that is. I sure hope to be driving for a long time.\"\nWhy can't the media just respect Kenseth's decision and leave him alone?\nKenseth knew there were questions about his move and wanted to fulfill interview requests for as many reporters as possible. It was his decision to talk for so long.\nHe spent three straight hours on Wednesday afternoon doing phone interviews with 13 different reporters and answering mostly the same questions the entire time.\nI'm still confused. Will all the details about Kenseth's decision come out eventually?\nNot if the driver has his way. Kenseth, who has always been a private person, said there's nothing to be gained by talking about some of the specific conversations or factors that led to the move.\n\"There are a fair amount of closed-door things or feelings or circumstances or whatever that will probably never get talked about, just because it doesn't do anybody any good at the end of the day,\" he said.\nThat said, once Kenseth and his new team make their announcement, everything might make more sense.", "id": "<urn:uuid:31e28d16-6525-4105-ac64-d727e8d0c219>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.sbnation.com/nascar/2012/6/27/3121646/matt-kenseth-nascar-roush-fenway-racing-2012", "date": "2013-06-19T06:04:50Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368708142388/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516124222-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9924909472465515, "token_count": 1414}, "content": [{"line": "After speaking with Matt Kenseth via phone on Wednesday afternoon, I feel like I have a better grasp on why he made the decision to leave Roush Fenway Racing for a yet-to-be-named team (likely Joe Gibbs Racing).", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "While Kenseth can't or won't say everything that led to his decision, he was very forthcoming about the details he felt he could talk about.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Here are some common questions from you and a few answers that might help you understand the move:", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Kenseth doesn't have a full-time sponsor at Roush this year and might not have had one next year.

{"doc": {"text": "PASSIVE COMPONENTS, like many other building blocks in the high-frequency industry, have improved in terms of electrical performance per unit size over the last five decades. When looking back over the years at earlier passive components and assemblies, it is not so much the pure electrical performance that is striking as much as the advances in packaging that have taken place over that time.\nIn 1980, for example, one of the leading suppliers of microwave mixers, Watkins-Johnson of Palo Alto, CA, made news with their M4 series of flatpack mixers. The products included the model WJ-M4A with local-oscillator (LO) and RF range of 10 to 1500 MHz and intermediate-frequency (IF) range of DC to 1000 MHz.\nDuring the same time period, a company still going strong, Mini-Circuits, was selling coaxial power dividers for only $39.95 each. The firm's ZAPD line of power dividers included models from 0.5 to 1.0 GHz, 1.0 to 2.0 GHz, and 2.0 to 4.2 GHz (Fig. 1). The insertion loss was 0.2 dB for all models, still considered good today.\nAnother company still going strong, ARRA, Inc., of Westbury (now Bay Shore), NY, offered a line of miniature continuously variable attenuators in 1968. Available for applications from 2.0 to 12.4 GHz, the attenuators handled 5 W average power and 3 kW peak power with maximum insertion loss of 0.5 dB.\nAn article in March 1968 by members of the technical staff of the Microwave Department of Sylvania Electric Products, Inc. of Woburn, MA detailed how a new type of diode, the beamlead Schottky barrier diode (Fig. 2), appeared to be a more electrically efficient device than point-contact diodes for frequency-conversion applications. The article compared the performance characteristics of both semiconductor devices, and showed how a microwave mixer could be formed using a beam-lead Schottky diode pair (Fig. 3).\nAround the same time, Bill Marshall, Switch Marketing Manager for Transco, demonstrated his firm's modular approach to waveguide switch assemblies (Fig. 4). Using a variable waveguide switch design, the assemblies performed transmitter switching to 18 GHz under full-power operation. They provided switching speed of better than 50 ns.\nThe Micro State Electronics Operation of Raytheon in Murray Hill, NJ was working with advanced stripline, leading to the group's development of a switch/driver assembly for applications from 1020 to 1100 MHz (Fig. 5). It achieved hot switching of 10 kW peak power in only 150 ns.\nFor those who doubted digital technology existed five decades ago, Daico Industries offered a pair of digital variable attenuators with integral TTL (model DA0295) and CMOS (model DA0285) drivers. Switching under 7-b control, the digital attenuators (Fig. 6) provided 63.5-dB attenuation control ranges from 30 to 500 MHz with least significant bit (LSB) of 0.5 dB.

{"doc": {"text": "Business Pundit has a post today about a new auction site named jittery.\nOne thing BusinessPundit mentions is that the new site will have a\n\"Buy Offer\" feature, which I believe gave him the idea in the first place. Basically, instead of buyers competing over an item and raising the price, buyers specify what they want to buy, which features are important, what prices they want to pay, and sellers compete to give them the best deal.\nI am extremely skeptical that this would work. As background, I ran the marketplace portion of Mercata, that similarly tried to bring a different, more buyer focused model to table and failed fairly spectacularly. We found that you can be as innovative as you want, but you need a lot of traffic to your site, and building such traffic takes a lot of time or a lot of money or both. You also need to provide a value proposition for both buyers AND sellers.\nA LOT of people have tried some sort of reversal of the auction process, where buyers specify the goods they want and sellers bring them to the table, bidding against each other (ie lower and lower prices) to get the business. FreeMarkets made some hay with this in the B2B world, but from the beginning the auctions were never really the money maker, but were a Trojan horse for supply chain consulting, which helps to explain why they merged with Ariba.\nThe only people to make this model work in the consumer area is Priceline. However, what most people fail to realize about Priceline is that it fulfilled a real business need for SELLERS, even more than for buyers.\nAirlines have a classic fixed cost pricing problem. They want to sell as many tickets at a high price as possible, but an incremental passenger costs them nothing, so if the plane is not full, getting even $50 for a passenger to fill an empty seat at the last minute is profitable to them. The problem is somehow offering the $50 fare only to the passenger who would not fly otherwise, and not cannibalizing the customers who are willing to pay $300.\nThe problem is, if they offer the $50 fare to anyone, they can't hide the fact very well. The airline industry, as most know, have very transparent computer systems that let everyone know their prices on every route every minute of the day. If an airline cuts prices on a route, everyone knows - so that competitors can match the cut immediately and customers can switch from the higher to lower fairs. Airlines protect themselves somewhat with limited availability of certain fares and advanced purchase requirements - so that people, particularly business travelers, who need to maintain flexibility, have a reason to pay higher fares.\nHowever, advanced purchase requirements were not providing enough protection. What airlines really wanted was a way to cut fares for one person who might not have flown otherwise, and let no one else see them do it. And Priceline was the answer. Yes, airlines had to tell the Priceline computers what the lowest bid they would accept from a customer for a flight was, but this did not constitute an official price that went into the reservation systems. So, the airlines could cut their price (via Priceline), but only the customer who got the price ever saw it.\nIn fact, the story is even better. At the time Priceline came around, one airline had a particular problem they needed to solve. When TWA got a loan from Carl Icahn, an almost unnoticed part of the deal was that a certain travel agency owned by Icahn, small at the time, would be guaranteed TWA tickets at a healthy discount off the lowest published fares. This agency, with this boondoggle, grew to enormous size as Lowestfare.com. TWA, beyond the reasons listed above, therefore had a second reason for not wanting to publish their lowest possible fare. Normal limitations that most airlines could set on how many seats would be available at their lowest fare could not be enforced by TWA. If they offered a new $100 fare, Lowestfare.com could blow out an unlimited number of tickets at $80 or less and TWA would have to accept it. Therefore, by offering discounts unpublished via Priceline, TWA prevented the travel agency from getting inventory even cheaper. And so, a huge portion of the early Priceline inventory was TWA. (ironically, after the American Airlines acquisition of TWA killed the deal, the Lowestfare.com URL was bought by ... Priceline.\nAnyway, I just don't see how reverse auctions can work in the consumer world, particularly if the customers are allowed to specify price and quality and features, etc. The transaction costs for suppliers would be just too high wading through this stuff -- in fact, many companies in the B2B world, where transaction sizes are in the millions, have come to this same conclusion - for a variety of reasons, they are choosing not to participate in reverse auctions (here too).\nMarketplaces must offer value to both buyer and seller. If you don't offer honest value to sellers, then no products appear on the site and it will fail.\nBasically, there are two gorilla's in the online marketplace arena - eBay and Amazon. eBay had the head start in building a brand and community in the marketplace space, but Amazon has brought some really nifty technology to the table.\nAs a user of both, I welcome a new competitor, sortof. I hope that there will be competitors who force eBay to adopt some overdue new features (e.g. auction sniping protection and better search features on past auctions) but I don't really want any to be successful enough to create a third or fourth or fifth major platform out there, because that just increases my search costs and time when I want to buy something.\nI missed pointing out one bit of irony.

They want to sell as many tickets at a high price as possible, but an incremental passenger costs them nothing, so if the plane is not full, getting even $50 for a passenger to fill an empty seat at the last minute is profitable to them. The problem is somehow offering the $50 fare only to the passenger who would not fly otherwise, and not cannibalizing the customers who are willing to pay $300.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "The problem is, if they offer the $50 fare to anyone, they can't hide the fact very well. The airline industry, as most know, have very transparent computer systems that let everyone know their prices on every route every minute of the day. If an airline cuts prices on a route, everyone knows - so that competitors can match the cut immediately and customers can switch from the higher to lower fairs. Airlines protect themselves somewhat with limited availability of certain fares and advanced purchase requirements - so that people, particularly business travelers, who need to maintain flexibility, have a reason to pay higher fares.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "However, advanced purchase requirements were not providing enough protection. What airlines really wanted was a way to cut fares for one person who might not have flown otherwise, and let no one else see them do it. And Priceline was the answer. Yes, airlines had to tell the Priceline computers what the lowest bid they would accept from a customer for a flight was, but this did not constitute an official price that went into the reservation systems. So, the airlines could cut their price (via Priceline), but only the customer who got the price ever saw it.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "In fact, the story is even better. At the time Priceline came around, one airline had a particular problem they needed to solve. When TWA got a loan from Carl Icahn, an almost unnoticed part of the deal was that a certain travel agency owned by Icahn, small at the time, would be guaranteed TWA tickets at a healthy discount off the lowest published fares. This agency, with this boondoggle, grew to enormous size as Lowestfare.com. TWA, beyond the reasons listed above, therefore had a second reason for not wanting to publish their lowest possible fare. Normal limitations that most airlines could set on how many seats would be available at their lowest fare could not be enforced by TWA. If they offered a new $100 fare, Lowestfare.com could blow out an unlimited number of tickets at $80 or less and TWA would have to accept it. Therefore, by offering discounts unpublished via Priceline, TWA prevented the travel agency from getting inventory even cheaper. And so, a huge portion of the early Priceline inventory was TWA.

{"doc": {"text": "This sophisticated, medium-bodied white was aged for 11months in French oak and offers elegant yet concentrated notes of pink grapefruit, lemon/lime zest and slightly under ripe Golden apples. Its supple and polished texture is framed by racy acidity and notes of flint, meal and lanolin.\nEstablished in 1944, this benchmark estate has produced wines of elegance and finesse for over half a century. Founded by Mick Brajkovich, his wife Kate and son Mate, this 74 acre property is located in Kumeu, a subregion of the Auckland wine district on New Zealand’s North Island. The winery is currently managed by Mate’s wife, Melba and their children, Marijana, Michael, Milan and Paul. Marijana manages the financial and accounting side of the business, Milan oversees vineyard management and viticulture, Paul runs sales and marketing and Michael is the winemaker. Although the winery is situated well north of New Zealand’s other viticultural regions, its proximity to the Tasman Sea and the Pacific Ocean ensures a moderate, maritime microclimate. The clay and underlying sandstone base soils of the area have superior water retention qualities, thereby eliminating the need for irrigation. All vines are grown in a sustainable manner and to take advantage of the long growing season are trained on a “Lyre” trellis. During harvest, the grapes are picked by hand and sorted in the vineyard. Michael was New Zealand’s first Master of Wine and 2012 marks his 31st consecutive vintage with Kumeu River. Not content to rest on his laurels, this humble winemaker perpetually searches for ways to improve his wines. Through trial and error, he has developed a regimen that includes whole cluster pressing, minimal use of new oak, wild yeast fermentation, completion of malolactic fermentation and extended barrel aging sur lie. Kumeu River was also the first winery in New Zealand to bottle exclusively in screw cap closures. The family’s hard work and commitment to the Brajkovich legacy has been duly recognized – their Chardonnays are considered amongst the best in the world and they have been consistently named in the Top 100 Wines of the world by Wine Spectator. Kumeu River wines balance wonderful raciness with great concentration and structure – a characteristic that has become the hallmark of this emblematic estate.\n|Kumeu River Wines was established in 1944 in the small country settlement of Kumeu, about 20 km northwest of Auckland.\nAt Kumeu River Wines, the winemaking philosophy is simple. We endeavour to grow grapes of the highest standard and then treat them with respect when we turn them into wine. In this way the potential quality is maximised, and we are able to produce wines that are truly representative of our land.\nTo this end, yields are kept low to improve the concentration of aromas and flavours in the grapes, and we harvest all of our grapes by hand. The white grapes are all whole-bunch pressed, which is time-consuming but gives us the best quality results. The reds are destemmed and crushed gently before being transferred to fermentation tanks. No yeasts are added.\nOak barrels from France play a significant, but never dominant, role in our wines. The white wines undergo fermentation in barrels, and the flavour nuances that are derived from this phase are crucial to these fine wine styles. The red wines are fermented for a prolonged period in stainless steel tanks, but they are also later matured in oak barrels to promote the development of bouquet and to soften the tannin structure of the palate. These are wines of great flavour intensity and complexity, but also with subtlety and elegance, and the potential to develop with further age.\nWe promote the malo-lactic fermentation in both our red and white wines. This bacterial transformation reduces and softens the acidity, and rounds out and complexes the flavour.\nThe Brajkovich Family is committed to ensuring that all Kumeu River wines are not only properly and correctly produced, but also possess characters of aroma and flavour that give our customers a great deal of drinking pleasure.", "id": "<urn:uuid:2850b75a-50d2-4dac-acb8-e4ae011a8332>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.trainoswine.com/vsku1773148.html", "date": "2013-05-22T14:19:31Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368701852492/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516105732-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9575262665748596, "token_count": 857}, "content": [{"line": "This sophisticated, medium-bodied white was aged for 11months in French oak and offers elegant yet concentrated notes of pink grapefruit, lemon/lime zest and slightly under ripe Golden apples.

Republican candidate for president Sen. John McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin stepped off their brightly-lit Straight Talk Air chartered jet last night, into a cool mist visible in the blazing headlights of the happy caravan that waited to carry them straight toward their date with destiny - Election Day.\nIt won't be cool and misty around Gov. Palin for long, however.\nThe campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has already sc`ored her for attracting some $300 in earmarks for every man, woman and child in Alaska - compared to the national average of $30 per person in other states.\nShe quickly struck back on Saturday, though, saying Sen. Obama had won more than abillion dollars in earmarks for hi Illinois constituency. \"Just wait till John McCain puts a stop to that,\" she said.

{"doc": {"text": "What can you do to create a healthier personal environment?\nAssess your nest.\nWorking with a home inspector, public health professional, contractor, or other construction expert as a guide, ask yourself some questions to evaluate your current house or apartment's environmental health:\n- Are you free of the \"big three?\" Radon, mold, and lead are all common home toxins. Radon testing is widely available, and best practices exist in new construction to minimize radon entry into the property. Check for moisture problems that act as hotbeds for mold growth, and look into mold testing if necessary. Finally, lead is present in many older homes' paint and pipes. Call your local public health department for information on testing for and eliminating lead in your home.\n- How well-ventilated is your home? While solid construction decreases your home's energy loss, a home that is too airtight can seal in indoor air pollutants. Proper ventilation also helps control moisture and reduce risk of mold and other environmental health concerns. Simple fixes to increase ventilation include installing ceiling fans and operable skylights and windows.\n- Does your landscaping contribute to your environmental health? Large lawns traditionally require greater pesticide use, and increase air and noise pollution generated from mowing. Consider planting perennial groundcovers, native foliage, or other low-maintenance landscaping. Even better, landscape with edible plants and devote a portion of your yard to organic vegetable gardening.\nBefore you rent or begin new construction, consider these additional questions:\n- Will your new space support recycling/reuse with storage space for cans, bottles, paper, and other items?\n- What is your potential home's proximity to major noisemakers like airports, railroad tracks, or highways?\n- What will keep you warm? Although most mainstream commercial insulations are considered safe, check out some healthy alternative insulation, including those made with recycled denim and other cloth, wool, icynene and nanogel.\n- How big is your planned home? Small is good. A well-planned home with less square footage uses fewer building and maintenance resources.\nClear the air.\nConsider these steps toward improving indoor air quality:\n- In your home, radon and mold tend to be the most serious barriers to indoor air quality. Relatively inexpensive tests exist to assess your home's mold and radon levels.\n- The United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) offers guidelines about common workplace air quality complaints, which usually focus on temperature, humidity, lack of outside air ventilation or smoking. Find out more .\n- For employees in farming and industrial fields, on-the-job outdoor air quality is also a concern. Each state has a department of environmental health within its main health department that can advise workers and employers on outdoor air quality regulations. To find your state's health department, visit the Centers for Disease Control site.\n- If you smoke, stop. If you live with someone who smokes, insist on a strict outdoor smoking policy. Approximately 3,000 American adults die of lung cancer each year due to secondhand smoke exposure. In young children, secondhand smoke increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and asthma.\nKnow your H20.\nIncrease your water quality with these tips:\n- The longer water has been sitting in pipes, the more lead it may contain. Run or \"flush\" your tap for up to two minutes, depending upon how long it's been between uses.\n- Since hot water is more likely to contain lead, only drink, cook and make baby formula with cold water.\n- The only way to be totally certain about your home's water quality is to have it tested. This is especially important for people in high-rise buildings, where \"flushing\" the pipes may not be as effective. Your local water supplier, health department or university can offer information about credible testing resources.\n- Water filters have been shown to increase purity. Filters can range from simple pitcher-based systems to more elaborate reverse-osmosis home units.\n- Remember that bottled water is not necessarily of higher quality than regular tap water. And according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, 60 million plastic bottles a day are manufactured, transported and then disposed of in U.S. landfills, compromising your community's environmental health.\nGreen your cleaning.\nAre your cleaning products messing up your health? While we're far from knowing the health impact of all chemicals used in cleaning agents, you can easily (and very inexpensively) create your own house-healthy cleaners. Some tips:\n- Mix either vinegar or baking soda with warm water in a spray bottle, and you've got an effective, all-purpose cleansing agent.\n- Bypass commercial air deodorizers, many of which contain formaldehyde. Instead, add cinnamon, essential oils, cloves, or any herbs you like to a pan of boiling water, and let the sweet steam deodorize.\n- On laundry day, reach for Borax (sodium borate). This natural mineral acts as a stain-remover, bleach alternative and detergent booster. Baking soda can remove stains and deodorizes, and cornstarch absorbs greasy stains and starches your clothing. Lemon juice can also double for bleach.\n- Salt (sodium chloride) is a mild abrasive for cleaning bathrooms and kitchens.\n- Consider hiring a \"green\" cleaning service, or ask your traditional housekeeper to use the methods and products you find healthiest.\nIncrease your chemical awareness.\nWhile it's impractical to try to have no contact with chemicals, you can reduce your chemical exposure in relatively simple ways:\n- Some beauty products contain chemicals that are anything but pretty. For example, nail polish, body lotions, and perfumes often contain phthalates, a controversial substance linked to birth defects in animals and possibly humans. Shampoos that attack dandruff might also play havoc on your health; the active ingredient selenium sulfide is a neurotoxin and possible carcinogen. Hair dyes often have coal tar, another chemical linked to cancer. So read labels, and choose a product that will be as lovely for your health as it is for your appearance.\n- Don't create toxic trash. If you're tossing old medications, resist flushing them down the toilet, where they can invade water supplies. Also consider calling your local recycler, many of which accept old cleaning products, paint, oil and other chemicals that create even more treacherous landfills.\n- Be sure to air out your garments after a trip to the drycleaners. Dry cleaning employs a chemical called perchloroethylene, which is actually toxic to humans. Some environmentally conscious cleaners use methods that do not contain \"perc;\" seek them out. Better yet, when possible choose clothing that only requires a trip to your laundry room, not a professional cleaner.\n- Be mindful of plastic use. Some plastics contain bisphenol A (BPA), an estrogen-like chemical potentially linked to cancer. Experts also advise against microwaving food in plastic containers; although research is inconclusive, the heating process is thought to release chemicals from the plastic into your food. Reusing plastic bottles is another source of controversy. Some experts think reuse is safe if you carefully wash and dry the bottles between each use, while others feel that wear and tear on the plastic causes toxic chemical leakage. An always-safe alternative is glass. Finally, you can reduce the amount of plastic produced by recycling. Look at the bottom of your plastic container for a number from 1-7. Items labeled 1 or 2 (usually soft drink, jjuice, water, milk, and detergent containers) are eligible for curbside recycling. Numbers higher than 2 are either unrecyclable or require special drop-off at a recycling center.\nReduce the roar.\nDecrease sound pollution at home and work with these simple suggestions:\n- Employ low-tech solutions like earplugs and heavy curtains to block street noise.\n- White noise machines and noise-cancelling headphones also create quiet.\n- Double-paned windows reduce outdoor noise, including jet traffic.\n- Before you begin new construction projects, communicate with your architect and/or contractor about noise reduction options. Some building materials and methods offer greater sound absorption or masking than others.\n- When you are engaged in construction projects, or if you work in construction or another noisy trade, always wear hearing protection on the job.\n- Be mindful about your personal noise production. For example, are you really watching your television, or is it simply on as \"background noise?\" Could you use a push mower instead of a power model, a shovel rather than a snow blower? Could you bike instead of drive? Select \"vibrate\" rather than the latest ringtone? Even small actions increase the peace.\nRaise your EMF awareness.\nIt is important to note that research on EMF exposure is ongoing. But these easy actions just might improve your wellbeing:\n- When possible, use a land line rather than your cell phone.\n- Use a hands free device or speaker phone function if using a cell phone.\n- Do not stand directly in front of your microwave oven while it's in use, or simply use your conventional oven.\n- Limit your computer time.\n- Use manual versions of personal care tools: an old-fashioned toothbrush rather than an electric model, or a razor instead of an electric shaver.\n- Don't sleep under an electric blanket.\n- Sit several feet from your television screen.\nEnjoy local and organic foods.\nThe foods you choose not only impact your health from a nutritional standpoint, but from an environmental angle as well. Think about these fast facts:\n- Eating locally grown produce means less transportation is required to get that apple from the tree to your table. This translates to reduced air and noise pollution in your community.\n- Organic farming doesn't employ the pesticides often used in non-organic methods. That means that eating organic produce may reduce your ingestion of chemicals, and that pesticides will not leach into local water supplies. Joining a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) food plan might \"cleanse\" your diet and help your water supply.\n- Research indicates that raising livestock increases greenhouse gas emissions, pollutes water supplies, and contributes to land degradation and deforestation.

{"doc": {"text": "The Bottom Whisperer: Freak Like Me\nGreeting fandome! Hope everyone is having an awesome week. Happy hump day! Follow me on facebook and twitter if you aren’t already. If you’re lucky I might go all Chris Brown and tweet pictures of my junk (not really).\nCheck out last week’s column just in case you missed it.\nDear Bottom Whisperer,\nI recently came out of the closet after being away at college for my sophomore year. I made friends at school who helped make my coming out experience really great. My family has also been very supportive since I came out to them. I recently went on a few dates with a guy from one of my classes. On our third date we went back to his place and got it on. Once we got down to our underwear and were making out on his bed he stopped for a second and with a kinda embarrassed look said to me “I just want you to have a heads up so you aren’t disappointed, I am not very hung. Don’t worry tho, I am totally cool just being the bottom sexually.” This really took me off guard and kinda killed the mood. We made out some more but then I told him I had to head home.\nI feel weird now because we had a nice time together. So many things are going through my head. Do less hung guys have to be the bottom? If I’m not hung do I have to apologize to the guy I’m with? This whole situation just kinda blew my mind. I feel awkward around him now and I think he is into me and wants to keep seeing each other.\nTrying Out Playing Sorry\nThere is no gay rulebook, and if there were, it would not have a rule that you have to apologize if your member isn’t “above average”. This guy clearly has some insecurity about what he’s packing downstairs, not your issue to deal with/take on/worry about. There are plenty of guys out there who are average and not hung who are tops. Your old pal The Bottom Whisperer can vouch that there are some bottom boys out there packing some serious heat downstairs. Unless you run your sex life like a communist work program, people should be welcome to do whatever they want (within reason) in the bedroom. Not every hung guy wants to be a big old top daddy, not every average guy wants to bite the pillow.\nGood on you for seeing how ridiculous this way of thinking is. I hope your dinner friend can have a similar moment of clarity. Yes there are people who fetishize hung guys, just like there are people who fetishize certain body types, ethnicity, body modification, etc. Don’t allow yourself to be put into a box because of your physical features. Never apologize for being the way that you are (unless it’s drunk and you just spilled on a really nice piece of furniture) and feel good about you! If you want to top, bottom, both, neither, in a car, in a bar, with a star…. Go for it. There are no rules, besides rules are just there to be broken. Happy humping!\nDear Bottom Whisperer,\nI’m a twenty-something, educated, professional gay man living on the West Coast. I have been seeing a guy romantically for a couple of months now. We really enjoy each other and are about at the point where we should discuss seeing each other exclusively. But there is one thing that has been weighing heavily on my conscience as of late. My awesome gentleman-friend is very close to his ex-boyfriend. Normally this wouldn’t be an issue for me but it is pretty obvious that his ex still has some serious feelings for him.

I think it is great that you haven’t flipped and asked your man-friend what is up or to pick one of you, because that would just make you look bad. It is possible your guy is a bit of an attention whore and loves having 2 hot guys pine after him, he could also be completely clueless. Either way, don’t let this guy’s actions sweat you because he is just trying to get a reaction out of you, and if you give it to him, you give him the keys to the Porsche. He will know he can get a stir out of you and then it is game over.\nNow if he continues and even becomes more brazen with his attempts to manipulate you or your guy, you’re gonna have to put the ball in your man’s court. A simple “Maybe we should take a break so you can work through some of the stuff you have hanging around from your ex.” Should do the trick. If he likes you he will get the picture. By allowing his ex to meddle with your business you are not setting healthy boundaries with your new guy. These situations happen quite a bit and it is very difficult as the new person in the dynamic to come out of it looking like a class act. Most people wanna get all Jerry Springer and start a screaming match. Don’t stoop so low. If this guy is a good fit and meant to be, he needs to reel it in and get his ex in check.

{"doc": {"text": "- Sticky, Gooey, Creamy, Chewy - http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com -\nEaster Brunch SGCC-Style\nPosted By Susan On April 1, 2012 @ 4:31 pm In Holidays,Recipes,SGCC Rewinds | 13 Comments\nOf the great triumvirate of Christian holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter), Easter is my favorite. While I love eating myself into oblivion at Thanksgiving, and Christmas (the gifts are nice too), I actually enjoy the fact that Easter isn’t as food-centric. I find it to be a much more relaxing and low-key holiday than the others, which in turn means less stress for me. And, I’m all about less stress these days! While, it would be unthinkable in my family to have Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner in a restaurant (gasp!), the same does not apply to Easter. Unless we’re invited to someone’s home, we almost always enjoy our Easter meal at one of our favorite restaurants.\nOn the other hand, if your family is anything like mine, they will be clamoring for food long before the time a 4:00 dinner reservation rolls around. To stave off the hungry horde, I always prepare a few dishes ahead of time that can either be warmed up in the oven or simply served cold that morning. Here are some great “stress-less” brunch ideas from the SGCC archives for a lovely, laid back, Easter Sunday brunch.\nFresh, ripe strawberries are blended with yogurt, sour cream, lime juice and honey to make this rich and lush chilled soup. It’s like a cross between a mousse and a smoothie. Frozen berries can also be used in a pinch. Whip it up a day or two in advance, although it may not last that long.\nChicks in a Nest \nChicks in a Nest is a great dish to serve for a brunch buffet. Each serving is completely self-contained and can just be picked up and popped on a plate. The “nests” are made from shredded potatoes that are baked in a muffin tin, which are then served filled with scrambled or poached eggs. You can shred your own potatoes or use a bag of the pre-shredded kind, like I did. The potato nests can be made a day ahead and crisped up in the oven before serving.\nA strata is casserole made with bread, eggs and whatever cheese, meats or vegetables you feel like putting into it. Think of it as a savory bread pudding. This one is filled with onions, ham, mozzarella and Swiss cheese. The best thing about a strata is that it’s meant to be made in advance. In fact, it really must be put together and allowed to sit for several hours or overnight before baking. For your trouble, you’re rewarded with a puffy and golden mass of cheesy, meaty, eggy goodness.\nA kugel is actually a Jewish dish, commonly served on holidays and special occasions. It’s a baked casserole, sweet or savory, that is usually made with egg noodles or potatoes, and often with cottage or cream cheese. In this savory version, I’ve blended cottage cheese, sour cream and a velvety chevre with noodles and assorted vegetables for a sumptuous dish with a subtle tang. A dusting of panko crumbs on top gives it a little crunch and extra texture. This kugel is best baked up a day ahead and served at room temperature.\nThis light and luscious chicken salad is chock full of fresh and dried fruits and nuts bathed in a creamy dressing punctuated with fresh herbs. You can use any combination and quantity of fruits, nuts and herbs that you like, and it always turns out great. Served in big, juicy, hollowed out tomatoes, pineapple boats or avocado halves, this Tutti Frutti Chicken Salad really sings Springtime!\nThis lovely little salad features crisp tender green beans, potatoes, sweet grape tomatoes and thin slivers of red onion. I pair it with a zesty vinaigrette, accented with Dijon mustard, lemon, garlic, honey and fresh herbs. Serve it either warm or chilled and topped with some chopped hard boiled egg for extra richness. It makes a lovely complement to any meal.\nThis pasta salad is quick and ridiculously easy to put together. And, it’s full of zesty, bold flavors. The dressing is simply a mixture of mayonnaise, lemon juice and store bought pesto sauce – the kind you find in the refrigerator section at the supermarket. You can serve it as is, or punch it up by mixing in some poached chicken, tuna or tasty little salad shrimp. Any way you serve this Presto Pesto Pasta Salad, your guests will be dishing out the complements!\nPizza Rustica \nOf course, no Easter Sunday brunch at Chez SGCC would be complete without a few traditional Italian Easter pies, like this Pizza Rustica. It’s a big, cheesy, meaty, creamy hunk of a pie stuffed to the gills with six different kinds of cured and fresh meat. Yes, I said SIX! One slice is pretty much a complete meal in itself. A Pizza Rustica does take some time to put together, but trust me, it is worth the effort. Plus, it can be made a few days in advance and is best served at room temperature.\nTorta di Riso \nTorta di Riso is a rich and creamy egg and ricotta based dessert pie filled filled with cooked Arborio rice and delicately flavored with the essence of orange. Think of it as rice pudding in a crust. This pie is usually made using a traditional rolled pie crust. But, I’ve made it a little easier to make and more interesting to eat by using layers of paper thin phyllo dough to envelope my filling. The phyllo gives this torta a delightfully crispy, buttery crust that shatters beneath your teeth as you bite into it. It’s simply amazing!\nAnd, we certainly can’t forget dessert, especially when it’s a luxuriously rich and creamy cheesecake like this one! My version of this Italian classic is made with both ricotta and mascarpone cheeses, giving it a super silky smooth texture. I flavor it with the heady combination or pure vanilla and a splash of orange flower water, that is sure to make both you and your guests swoon.\nButtery Lemon Bars \nLemon Bars are a quintessential Springtime treat. This version boasts a rich and buttery shortbread crust topped with an ultra-lemony curd that is the perfect balance of sweet and tart. These are honestly the best lemon bars I’ve ever eaten – bar none!\nArticle printed from Sticky, Gooey, Creamy, Chewy: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com\nURL to article: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2012/04/01/easter-brunch-sgcc-style/\nURLs in this post:\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/easter-brunch.jpg\n Sumptuous Strawberry Soup: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2008/06/18/summertime-an-the-livin-is-easy/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/strawberry-soup.jpg\n Chicks in a Nest: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2009/07/31/breakfast-at-tiffanys-roundup-chicks-in-a-nest/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ChicksinaNest1.jpg\n Anytime Ham, Cheese and Egg Strata: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2011/08/10/anytime-egg-ham-and-cheese-strata-recipe/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Egg-Strata-2.jpg\n Vegetable Noodle Kugel: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2009/01/29/savory-vegetable-noodle-kugel-for-rfj/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/kugel-23.jpg\n Tutti Frutti Chicken Salad: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2009/08/25/tutti-frutti-chicken-salad/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/chicken-salad-1.jpg\n Green Bean and Potato Salad with Dijon Vinaigrette: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2011/07/28/green-bean-and-potato-salad-with-dijon-vinaigrette-recipe/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/green-bean-dijonnaise-2.jpg\n Presto Pesto Pasta Salad: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2011/06/28/presto-pesto-pasta-salad-recipe/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/pesto-pasta-salad-4.jpg\n Pizza Rustica: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2008/03/15/baking-with-mom-part-1-pizza-rustica/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/pizza-rustica.jpg\n Torta di Riso: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2010/03/24/sgcc-encore-torta-di-riso-for-easter/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/torta-di-riso.jpg\n Italian Ricotta Cheesecake: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2011/02/20/la-tavola-della-mia-famiglia-italian-ricotta-cheesecake-recipe/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ricotta-cheesecake-1.jpg\n Buttery Lemon Bars: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2011/03/20/buttery-lemon-bars-a-recipe-in-pictures-or-what-was-i-thinking/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lemon-bars-1.jpg\nCopyright © 2009 StickyGooeyCreamyChewy.com.", "id": "<urn:uuid:41677772-38a3-4c75-bc5f-6ac1ebf9406a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2012/04/01/easter-brunch-sgcc-style/print/", "date": "2013-05-22T21:24:04Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368702448584/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516110728-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.8760274648666382, "token_count": 2502}, "content": [{"line": "- Sticky, Gooey, Creamy, Chewy - http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com -", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Easter Brunch SGCC-Style", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Posted By Susan On April 1, 2012 @ 4:31 pm In Holidays,Recipes,SGCC Rewinds | 13 Comments", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Of the great triumvirate of Christian holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter), Easter is my favorite.

{"doc": {"text": "If you're a \"Breaking Bad\" devotee, news that the Sundance Channel will begin airing Seasons 1 through 4 of the show (beginning tonight at 11 PM) is a welcome chance to rewatch one of (if not the) greatest TV dramas of all time.\nAnd for you \"Bad\" newbies … we envy you, because you have the chance to experience for the first time the unfolding of an incredibly written and acted story, led by two Emmy-winning actors (Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul) and an Emmy-worthy supporting cast.\nWith the last eight episodes of the series scheduled to premiere on AMC this summer, Sundance's off-network airings will run back to back every Monday night for the show's first 46 installments. Here, five moments every \"BB\" fan -- new and old -- should catch during the Sundance run (oh, MAJOR SPOILERS ahead):\n(Warning: The following clips contain violence and adult language.)\n1. Workin' at the car wash\nMake that not working at the car wash. In the series premiere, meek, fed-up high school chemistry teacher Walter White (Cranston) -- who has to work a second job at a car wash just to make ends meet for his family -- does his best Johnny Paycheck when he tells his gruff, bushy-browed car wash boss to take his job and shove it, while referencing the eyebrows, slapping around some air fresheners, and throwing in a crotch grab for good measure. It's the first moment Walt really lets go of years of pent-up frustration, though it's certainly not the last.\n2. The birth of Heisenberg\nSeason 1, \"Crazy Handful of Nothin'\"\nAs Walt's partner in crime, Jesse (Paul) would later proclaim, \"Yay, science!\" In this case, that science is fulminated mercury, which Walt uses to get the attention -- and the business -- of drug lord Tuco. Old Walt, meek Walt, would never have had the nerve to stand up to the menacing Tuco (Raymond Cruz), but Jesse has been beaten up and Walt's had to shave his head for chemotherapy. And in his new, emboldened state, his alter ego \"Heisenberg\" strides into Tuco's headquarters, blows the joint up (using the mercury), and demands that Tuco buy his special brand of crystal meth. With payment upfront.\n3. What would you do?\nSeason 2, \"Phoenix\"\nWalt had a choice in this episode, the penultimate installment of the season, when Jesse's new girlfriend, Jane (Krysten Ritter), was choking to death after a drug binge with fellow addict Jesse: Walt could save her life … or, he could save almost a half-million dollars in cash, and make sure Jane was no longer around to influence Jesse. It took the series' ability to shock -- and Walter White's conscience -- to a whole other level, and led to even more shocking fallout in the season finale.\n4. \"I am the one who knocks\"\nSeason 4, \"Cornered\"\nSkyler, realizing fully what danger Walt's enterprise has put her and the kids in, pleads with him to turn to the police to protect them. They're in danger, she argues. But Walter, fully believing his own Heisenberg hype by this point, just gets annoyed with her insistence that he's in danger, and that the bad guys are going to come knocking on their door. \"I am not in danger, Skyler, I am the danger … a guy opens his door and gets shot, and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!\"\n5. Blown away\nSeason 4, \"Face Off\"\nNot even \"The Wire\" or \"The Sopranos\" put forth a more complicated, calculating, villain than Giancarlo Esposito's Gus Fring, who found out in a very just way in the Season 4 finale that he was smarter than almost everyone … except Walter White.

{"doc": {"text": "Dt 8, 2-3, 14-16 Ps 147, 12-13; 14-15; 19-20 1 Cor 10, 16-17 Jn 6, 51-58\nMOSES URGES the Israelites: “Remember, the Lord, your God.” Their memorial is meant to keep them mindful of God's specific saving acts. Moses responds to the all-too-human inclination to forget the Lord, to overlook His redemptive works in our life, to neglect His offer of mercy and disregard God altogether.\nThat we, too, might remain mindful, Jesus gives us the great memorial of the Eucharist. And just as God guided the Israelites in the desert, so He guides our memory as we make our way to Him in the Eucharist. He does this in three ways:\nThe Eucharist responds to the human experience of hunger. God allowed the Israelites to “be a afflicted with hunger” in their desert wandering. But He does so in order to feed them Himself, with the miraculous food of manna, and to persuade them that “man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.” That is to say, thanks to divine Providence, the experience of hunger leads us back to God.\nHunger makes us cherish what really matters most in life— the Word of God. It rekindles our commitment to rely on God to provide what we need to make it through our own vast and terrible deserts, our own struggles with slavery. Hunger reminds us that the craving of our bodies is satisfied only by the human body of Jesus—the Word that proceeds from His mouth, offering us His flesh as food: “He who feeds on my flesh &hellips; has life eternal.”\nHunger, then, tests our intention to keep God's commandments, which is the surest sign of our love for Jesus (Jn 14, 21). Hunger makes us “true to his Word” (Jn 14, 22) as we accept the Eucharist—not as mere bread—but as “the best of wheat” filled with God's promise: “Anyone who eats this bread shall live forever.” The Eucharist satisfies hunger with the sustenance of hope.\nAt the same time, the Eucharist recalls how God glories in doing the impossible. The crowd quarrels: “How can He give us His flesh to eat?” But as we live by faith, we experience how the efficacy of the Eucharist transforms contradiction into grace-filled affirmation. Our sharing in the Body of Christ radically changes the way we look at things. Just as every occasion at table reminds us of our sharing in the Body and Blood of Christ, so, too, does every encounter in life prompt us to see the real presence of Jesus, who is at work in our midst as “the life of the world.”\nAnd the Eucharist reminds us how we are to regard ourselves. Jesus gives us His flesh and blood as real food and drink, so that we might become His Body. In Communion, Jesus promises to remain in us and we in Him. We are to look beyond the flaws and defects of our human bodies to discover within us the love of Jesus who transforms us into Himself.\nFather Peter John Cameron, who teaches homiletics at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, N.Y., is a Register contributing editor.", "id": "<urn:uuid:4a24ee2f-531a-4da1-948a-e52ba28975d3>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/this_sunday_at_mass1", "date": "2013-05-25T05:44:04Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368705559639/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516115919-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9432006478309631, "token_count": 728}, "content": [{"line": "Dt 8, 2-3, 14-16 Ps 147, 12-13; 14-15; 19-20 1 Cor 10, 16-17 Jn 6, 51-58", "label": "Formatting, Style, and Errors", "split": false}, {"line": "MOSES URGES the Israelites: “Remember, the Lord, your God.” Their memorial is meant to keep them mindful of God's specific saving acts.

At mosques around Iraq on Friday, his acolytes read a statement outlining new marching orders for his Mahdi Army militia aimed at maximizing his political support ahead of provincial elections scheduled for the fall.\nA select group of Mahdi Army fighters would continue to bear arms and use them against U.S. forces as long as they remain in Iraq. \"Weapons will be in the hands of this group exclusively and will be directed only at the occupier,\" Sadr's statement said. The rest of the militia, believed to number some 60,000 members, would focus on civic projects and religious initiatives that serve the needs of the Shi'ite community, Sadr said.\nThe new policy signals an end to Sadr's patience for the tattered unilateral cease-fire, which nominally restrained his men against U.S. troops this spring even as heavy fighting unfolded in southern Iraq and eastern Baghdad. More significantly, however, his new guerrilla approach seemed to exempt Iraqi government forces from attack by the Mahdi Army, while pitting his legions in a head-to-head political battle with al-Maliki for the hearts and minds of Iraqi voters ahead of the provincial elections. And continuing to fight U.S. forces seems to reflect an awareness that their long-term presence in Iraq is resented by a majority of Iraqis a resentment that also appears to have caused a stalemate in negotiations between the Iraqi and U.S. governments over a security agreement providing for a long-term American presence in Iraq.\nSadr has good reason to concentrate on the election his followers are poised to take the majority of open seats in southern Iraq and in large parts of Baghdad But two things could derail a massive victory at the polls: One would be a public relations disaster like the bloody firefight Sadr's fighters sparked outside a venerated Shi'ite shrine in Karbala roughly a year ago, the episode that led Sadr to declare a cease-fire in the first place. Sadr's new humanitarian drive appears aimed at shoring up his public image in the months before the vote by upstaging al-Maliki's predominantly Shi'ite government, which has struggled to provide basic services even in areas where his supporters live.\nThe second danger is a campaign by government supporters to keep the Sadrists off the ballot, which could spark a new confrontation in the months ahead. Sadr's followers are confident in taking on the government at the polls, but they are already accusing the government of laying the groundwork for a rigged election that would hand provincial power to the Sadrists' main rivals, the government-aligned Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council and its own militia, the Badr Brigade.\n\"They know that the Sadrist movement will win in the south,\" said a senior official from the main Sadr office in Baghdad who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"I don't think we're going to have a chance.\"\nIraq's Independent High Electoral Commission has vowed to ensure a fair contest and avoid the problems that troubled the last round of provincial balloting in 2005.

The designation also includes interior features.\nSt. Joseph's Hospital, built in 1876 with additions in 1888, 1897, and 1908, is valued for its association with the Sisters of St. Ann, its connection with the health care of Victoria's citizens, its architecture and architect, and its grounds.\nSt. Joseph's Hospital has value for its association with one of British Columbia's major pioneering religious orders, and for its role in the provision of health care in the region. It is a prominent reminder of the importance of the Sisters of St. Ann to the physical well-being of Victoria's citizens.\nFounded in Quebec in 1848, the Sisters of St. Ann represent the strong presence of French-Canadian missionaries in British Columbia's formative history. From the Pacific Northwest headquarters of the order at St. Ann's Academy, directly across Humboldt Street from this building, they gradually expanded their missionary work in Victoria to include a school, a convent, a novitiate program, and nursing services to better serve the educational, medical, and spiritual needs of the population for over a century.\nArchitecturally, the historic place was designed and built in stages, but it is the 1908 addition by Thomas Hooper and C. Elwood Watkins that is most prominent in today's configuration. The first phase of St. Joseph's Hospital was built on Collinson Street (now renamed Fairfield Road) in 1876 under the leadership of Sister Mary Providence and Dr. John Sebastian Helmcken. In 1888, an additional 48 beds were added, and in 1897, another 67, bringing the total to 150. The 1908 addition was designed to face Humboldt Street. With its Edwardian solidity and strong Neoclassical features, it serves as a foil to the Hooper wing at St. Ann's Academy and further reinforces the significance of the Order in Victoria's development. A historic chapel on the northeast of the structure has been preserved and provides a visual link to the religious past. Several interior features have been retained, further enhancing the historic importance of this building. It has been rehabilitated for use as seniors' housing with units for transient accommodation.\nIn addition, the grounds contribute to Victoria's natural environment. The building is surrounded by a manicured lawn with mature plantings that create a park-like setting. The presence of this greenspace so close to downtown Victoria, coupled with the St. Ann's Academy grounds and Beacon Hill Park just to the south, provides a counterpoint to the hard urban landscape of the city core.\nSource: City of Victoria Planning Department\nKey elements that define the heritage character of St. Joseph's Hospital include:\n- its monumental scale\n- characteristics of the Neoclassical Edwardian style, such as the front entrance porch with paired Ionic columns, balcony above with stone and cement balustrade, multi-hipped roof with gabled front extension, stone corbelling under eaves, circular light in gable peak, slender turret with Christian cross at peak, front extension over porch\n- semi-recessed second storey bays arcaded by pilasters\n- form and pattern of fenestration\n- design and detailing of the 1908 addition, attributable to Thomas Hooper and C.

{"doc": {"text": "Crown Complex, Southbank\nNobu is among the most famous japanese restaurants in Melbourne. The story behind the success of Chef Nobu Matsuhisa is a pretty inspiring one. With a striking experience in Peru, you can see its influence in Nobu’s menu with modern dishes that mix south american and japanese cuisine.\nHowever, when I heard about the “franchise” Nobu (with 25 restaurants in the world) one question came immediately to my mind: is Nobu (the person) still a chef or became a businessman? To answer this question, I went myself to this renown restaurant to test its reputation…authenticity? creativity?\nWith a range of prices of this level, I was expecting a beautiful interior decoration and a very intimate dining experience. The decor was indeed appealing but the whole atmosphere was not adequate for a personal dining experience.\nThe first feeling my girlfriend had when we went downstairs to the dinning room (upstairs being the bar) was “are we in a yumcha place?”. The place was packed with not much space between people and loud music in the background. When the waitress was speaking, we could barely hear what she was saying. I had to lean on the table or yell to chat with my gf. Because everyone has to speak up in this noisy basement, we could almost hear the conversation on the table beside…For this range of restaurant, Coco offers a more personal ambiance for a delightful experience.\nService was pretty good. We arrive on time for our booking but the table was not ready yet. Complimentary champagne helped to wait on the ground floor with the view on the Yarra river.\nDespite the busy period, dishes came without a long wait, our waitress was efficient and explained us the dish ( when we could hear it). With such prices, you would expect excellent service and I think Nobu does not fail here. The only thing I would recommend is for the non-japanese staff (most of them I think) to work on their japanese pronunciation. Hearing “irashaimase” with so many different tones and mispronunciations is not a good start to show authenticity to customers. It felt so weird; like the restaurant was overdoing to convince (themselves?) it is indeed a japanese restaurant.\nValue for money/taste\nPrices are very high and excellent service is not enough to justify such values. I need to be impressed at the first mouthful, to get a “woah” effect, to be blowed away, to levitate at the end of the meal. During most of the meal, I didn’t levitate a single nanometer above my chair. I’ll describe each dish we had and then put the price at the end so YOU can put this in perspective\nOyster with a trio of sauces (6 pieces)\nOysters were very fresh and tasty. Not too big but this doesn’t bother me, I prefer small and delicious oysters. The 3 sauces were interesting as they exhibit distinct flavors The first one with lemon, coriander and a bit of chili. This refreshing south american flavor matches with the oyster in a “classic” way (lemon juice/oyster) with a little kick at the end as the chili leaves a nice after-taste. The second one, more japanese with ponzu sauce is a classic japanese dressing for oysters that I really start to enjoy. It doesn’t replace my french favorite shallot vinegar with a dark bread, salty butter and dry white wine. The third one was made with an onion dressing that reminded me of how oysters are cooked or baked in Mainland China with more intense flavors. Quite interesting one.\nI was expecting a lot from this dish. Being in Japan for 6 months, Toro (fatty part of the tuna) is something you fall in love instantaneously. Unfortunately, no nostalgia hit me during this dish, served in a micro serve. We had a tea spoon to eat this, the caviar…well you can probably count them with the fingers of your hands and I’m not kidding. The tuna was tender but it didn’t melt the way I remember back in Japan with a strong tuna flavor that transports you into the sea.Tthe sauce is just an improved soy sauce with wasabi. That was merely at the level of a good negi-toro from a kaiten sushi in Japan but at least in Japan I wouldn’t have to pay…..$45! Yes, $45 for this! This is really crossing the line, this is really overpriced. I know toro is a rare item here but it doesn’t justify $45. If you can’t find a descent toro, either lower your price or just don’t serve it. With the overfishing of tuna, I would vote for the latter option.\nScampi Inaniwa pasta salad tossed in ceviche dressing and creamy mentaiko\nThis dish was the best savory dish we had this night. The scampi were fully seasoned and very creamy, the perfect way to eat scampis. A full lobster-like flavor from each bite was something I would have enjoyed even more if the pasta or udon were not that bland. Ceviche dressing, you mean lemon juice? I have the chance to have a chilean girlfriend and I had plenty of ceviche (fish cured in lemon juice and herbs). I didn’t get any feeling of having a taste of ceviche mixed with these udon. So is “ceviche dressing” just a fancy name for lemon juice for non-initiated customers who are easily impressed with names they don’t understand but are willing to pay the full price?\nBeside this, I couldn’t taste much from the mentaiko (fish roe). I really enjoyed the texture of the udon and its firmness harmonises nicely with the scampi but I’m not sure if the chef was looking for a light citrus flavor to cleanse our palate or was just in lack of inspirations (and seasonings).\n$40…..I wouldn’t pay that much for this dish, again, it’s because scampis are rare and highly seen as a small lobster but the dish needed more depth to justify $40. By the way, no need to remind you that there was ONE scampi.\nSoft Shell Crab with Umeshu Amazu Cherry Tomatoes, Peach Aji Amarilo Salsa\nA failed attempt to mix Asia and South America. The soft shell crab was nicely fried (not difficult from all the soft-shell crabs I ate) but there was no magic with the sauce. Just pieces of peach mixed with white wine or umeshu ( I couldn’t tell to be honest) sitting beside. With a beautiful presentation, the sauce and the crab were two distinct items with no consonance on the plate leaving me baffled for…$28\nI actually went there with this insurance. I have a friend who highly recommended the desserts at Nobu and I was honored to met Chef Yuko to receive a description of her piece of art. This is truly remarkable (and don’t forget I ate a lot of dessert in France and in Japan). There is too much happening on one dish but I’ll try my best to describe it:\nGreen tea financier – like a small compact sweet madelaine with delicious bitter contrast at the end with the green tea flavor\nA japanese donut filled with melting chocolate and banana to die for and surprisingly not too heavy\nA chocolate fondant and green tea ice cream – the chocolate used for the fondant is a high class french chocolate delivering full dark chocolate flavors. The fondant was served warmed with a melting core of chocolate in the middle. The cool green tea icecream is a delicious alternative to vanilla icecream with chocolate fondant.\nSweet light pudding with infused fruits and a little crispy biscuit.\nMandarin and mango sorbets were so refreshing, a good cleanser between these flavors.\nA sort of green tea and peach parfait was also a delight with crispy crumbles contrasted with peach and green tea mousse.\nMy favourite was the Suntory whisky cappuccino layered with crunchy coffee crumble, coffee crème, milk ice cream and whisky foam. The whole coffee was visually recreated with so different layers all surprising in texture and in taste. Fantastic!\nOnly $28! I really don’t get it. For the whole meal, there were single dishes above $40 and here, we have a symphony of desserts for $28. I think they need to lower the savory dish prices if they want a consistent menu.\nHard one to score. It’s a weird mix. Dishes were trying to be creative but failed in my opinion. The cooking staff must be japanese from what I tasted. Fortunately, Chef Yuko is able to show you the beautiful dessert you can find in Japan, a patisserie inspired by France but well balanced with light textures and japanese green tea flavors.\nI would never go back to Nobu. You want a high class japanese restaurant? Continue your walk in Crown to go up in the towers for Coco. Your money will be better spent there. With such high prices, nothing has succeeded in impressing me beside the desserts of Chef Yuko.\nLet’s face it, Nobu is a business, not a restaurant. The place is packed to make profit and forgets about the unique dining experience it should deliver. Nobu should visit Melbourne and do a bit of cleaning in how he envisions his melbournian restaurant. Nobu are for people who doesn’t know about japanese food and who is just looking for a place to impress by its reputation, people who are more focused on appearances than authenticity.\nIn my experience (it’s going to sound very funny and probably not politically correct), if you enter a japanese restaurant with non-japanese waiters, there is a high chance it’s either very tasty but very pricey or simply bland dishes covered by excellent service…Nobu is unfortunately a bit of both", "id": "<urn:uuid:761e63f5-ba43-418a-aab9-f47cc3d5ad01>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://vbladev13.wordpress.com/", "date": "2013-06-19T18:58:00Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368709037764/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516125717-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9644722938537598, "token_count": 2163}, "content": [{"line": "Crown Complex, Southbank", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Nobu is among the most famous japanese restaurants in Melbourne.

{"doc": {"text": "Now, after more than 20 years as a regular \"Today\" viewer, Wurtzel tunes to CBS most mornings.\nMultiply such defections and you have the chief reason for television's changing fortunes in morning news, where ABC's \"Good Morning America\" has ended NBC's epic 17-year winning streak on \"Today.\" ABC is growing—\"GMA\" has 110,000 more viewers each day this year than last—but not as much as NBC is slipping (437,000 viewers a day since last year).\nWurtzel, 57, left last spring because of \"Today\" co-host Ann Curry.\n\"Ann's interview style was like chalk on a board to me,\" she said. \"She leaned toward her interviewee and whispered her questions like someone had died. The more serious the interview, the quieter she got. When she replaced Meredith (Vieira), I tried to adjust and accept, but she just didn't work for me. Katie (Couric) and Meredith were relatable, empathetic and funny. Ann just seemed out of place.\"\nExecutives at NBC were quietly reaching the same conclusion and moved to replace Curry with Savannah Guthrie.\nThen came June 28, 2012, Curry's last day as co-host. She cried in bewilderment at her perceived failure at losing the job she had sought for years, as her uncomfortable\nSuddenly, a problem for NBC became a BIG problem. Even people who didn't particularly like Curry loathed the way she was dispatched. Except for two weeks during the Olympics, \"Today\" hasn't sniffed first place in the ratings since. During the first six months of 2012, \"Today\" averaged just under 5.2 million viewers each weekday. Since July 2, the audience has dropped to 4.59 million, according to Nielsen, the company that measures TV audiences. Without the two weeks of the London Olympics, the average is 4.3 million. That's a stunning drop, even accounting for typical lower viewership in the summer.\nAn informal survey of three dozen viewers who have left or are considering leaving \"Today\" turned up various explanations, including a feeling that the show had leaned too far in the direction of lighter, pop culture fare. The Curry dismissal was clearly a tipping point, however.\nWilliam Runge, a manager at an educational cable network who lives in suburban Winston-Salem, N.C., likened the treatment of Curry to \"a public flogging.\"\n\"The PR machine at NBC spent an enormous amount of time and effort convincing me that the 'Today' show team was actually part of my family, 'America's First Family,\" said Runge, 46, citing the show's advertising slogan. \"Guess what? They were right. These did feel like family members. So this is how you are going to treat a member of your family?\n\"You can debate for hours whether Ms. Curry was right for the role,\" he said. \"That's not the point. She was doing her job and was barely 11 months into it when they canned her in the most humiliating way possible.\"\nThe move was \"heart-wrenching,\" said Isabelle Langelier, a 40-year-old manager at a drug company from Montreal. \"It made me feel sick for her. And it made me turn the channel, probably permanently.\"\n\"While I thought Ann Curry's interviews were a little hokey at times, she is clearly the most genuine person in TV news,\" said Sarah Rosenthal, 53, a graduate student and mother of three from West Chester, Pa. \"After her unceremonious dumping, I turned it off. I have nothing against Savannah, and adore Natalie Morales, but there is just a different tone to the show.\"\nEven worse for NBC, a significant number of viewers appear to blame co-host Matt Lauer for the move. The network has consistently denied tabloid reports that Lauer was unhappy with Curry. \"Today\" Executive Producer Jim Bell said late last month that Lauer was being treated unfairly. Firing Curry was Bell's decision, he said.\nSome awkward public moments haven't helped. When Curry reappeared on \"Today\" during the London Olympics to introduce a story she had done, Lauer twice remarked that it was good to see her again. Curry didn't return the sentiment to the man she worked with for 15 years.\nTwo years ago, Lauer's positive \"Q\" score was 23—meaning 23 percent of people who knew him considered Lauer one of their favorite broadcasters, according to Marketing Evaluations Inc., a company that measures public sentiment toward well-known personalities. Now his positive score is 14. At the same time, \"Good Morning America\" co-host Robin Roberts' positive \"Q\" score jumped from 20 to 27.\nLangelier felt there was a perception that Lauer was \"king\" and others on the show aren't equal to him. Lyle Nelson, 40, a salesman from Avondale, Ariz., said Lauer was \"not someone I'd like to have a beer with.\"\n\"There is something about Matt Lauer, whether or not he was the reason for Curry's firing, that has changed and I do not like watching the show anymore,\" said John Friia, a 20-year-old aspiring journalist from Malverne, N.Y.\nFortunately for NBC, viewers don't seem to be taking out their unhappiness on Guthrie.\nProducers often say that viewing decisions for morning television can be intensely personal, since people are essentially inviting these personalities into their homes at an intimate time of day when they were getting ready for work. Feeling a part of the TV \"family\" they see on air is part of it, and sometimes the reasoning seems strange. Nelson said, for example, that he didn't like the couch on \"Today\" because it looked uncomfortable.\n\"In today's doom and gloom news programs, the 'Today' show gave me a lift to get my day started,\" said Taren Robin, 48, from Paris, Ky. \"I don't get that lift anymore, and I am in mourning over the fact. I haven't found anything I like better to take its place.\"\nAt least one-third of people who responded to a Twitter request to discuss the show cited its content for their discontent.\n\"I used to be a regular 'Today' show viewer but got tired of their formula,\" said Dan Laufer, 35, a sports marketer from Washington, D.C. \"Five minutes of hard news followed by an animal rescue story, the Kardashians and then pop culture or fashion. It's OK with me—in moderation.\"\nJoan Pierce is a 64-year-old retired nurse from Oklahoma City, Okla., who watched \"Today\" for 40 years. Now she says: \"I don't care what Lindsay Lohan does.\"\n\"I was fed up with the lack of actual news reporting, and more intense focus on silly, irrelevant things like women's fashion or the newest celebrity's recipe for a dinner I could never find the time or money to cook,\" said Zach Beale, a 23-year-old college student in Savannah, Ga.\nBiting as they may be, at least those complaints offer \"Today\" the seeds of potential recovery. \"Good Morning America,\" particularly in its second hour, has an even greater pop culture emphasis. Bell said his show will try to draw a greater contrast with its ABC rival in coming months. A recent ad with Lauer touts the \"informative\" nature of the show. Curry, who has kept her job with NBC as a hard news reporter, appeared on \"Today\" during the past month interviewing Libyan President Mohammed Magarief and reporting from Syria.\nCBS has already tried to position itself as a newsier alternative in the morning. Because \"Today\" has a richer history and often twice as many viewers, it would be in better position to reach people who want this.\nNBC announced this week that Willie Geist, an engaging and popular member of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" team, will join \"Today\" as a co-host of the 9 a.m. hour and occasionally appear earlier.\n\"What I loved about the show were the hosts, reporters and the stories,\" said Miriam Sajecki, a marketer from Staten Island, N.Y. who has watched \"Today\" for more than 20 years. \"It was always delivered in a friendly, engaging and informative manner. Some of that has changed in that I miss the chemistry that was displayed with the prior hosts ... and some of the stories 'Today' was known for. It has evolved into forgettable reports without giving me the important news and educational stories.\"\nStill, Sajecki is a loyalist. \"I will continue to watch the 'Today' show and wake up to it every weekday,\" she said.\nNBC needs devoted fans like Sajecki to turn things around.\nIt will take some time.", "id": "<urn:uuid:e918bf02-bf08-4338-9e8f-0130d7a19e50>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/leisure/ci_21748216/where-have-today-show-viewers-gone", "date": "2013-05-20T11:54:28Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368698924319/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516100844-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.985176146030426, "token_count": 1855}, "content": [{"line": "Now, after more than 20 years as a regular \"Today\" viewer, Wurtzel tunes to CBS most mornings.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Multiply such defections and you have the chief reason for television's changing fortunes in morning news, where ABC's \"Good Morning America\" has ended NBC's epic 17-year winning streak on \"Today.\" ABC is growing—\"GMA\" has 110,000 more viewers each day this year than last—but not as much as NBC is slipping (437,000 viewers a day since last year).", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Wurtzel, 57, left last spring because of \"Today\" co-host Ann Curry.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\"Ann's interview style was like chalk on a board to me,\" she said. \"She leaned toward her interviewee and whispered her questions like someone had died.

This letter, put together by the Water Protection Network, points out significant problems in this bill:\n“Particularly troubling are the streamlining provisions (Sections 2033 and 2032) which will force agency staff to make uninformed decisions, to rubber stamp unacceptable projects, and prioritize deadline compliance over effective review. They do this by:\nRequiring the Corps of Engineers to carry out the shortest review possible; Establishing arbitrary and unreasonably short deadlines for the public and resource agencies to comment;\nEstablishing arbitrary deadlines for resource agency decisions and recommendations;\nAllowing the Corps to elevate multiple technical and substantive disagreements all the way to the President; and\nDirecting the Corps to impose multiple and ongoing fines on resource agencies that miss deadlines or disagree with the Corps on issues fully within the expertise of the resource agencies.\nThese provisions also could give the Corps control over reviews that are clearly outside of its jurisdiction, including consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, review under the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, and reviews under laws governing activities in coastal areas and public lands.\nAdditionally, the bill threatens to exacerbate our nation’s fiscal deficits by rolling back long- established cost-sharing rules and expanding federal responsibilities into areas that have been the financial responsibility of non-federal project sponsors. If enacted as reported, the bill will result in overspending, overcapacity, and substantial and unnecessary damage to the nation’s major estuaries and harbors. Title VIII of the bill would immediately more than double spending on harbor maintenance without assurance of the cost-effectiveness or true need for the dredging. In addition, the Title eliminates the current 50 percent non-federal cost share for maintaining deep draft harbors from 45 to 50 feet of depth, making these costs 100 percent federal responsibility. The provision also makes dredging and maintenance of all approach channels to berths along federal navigation channels and all upland confined disposal of contaminated dredged sediments a 100 percent federal responsibility, rather than the current 100 percent non-federal responsibility. No one has ever even estimated the costs of such an expansion. This would likely cause increases in dredging of contaminated areas that otherwise never would have been contemplated, increasing toxic releases into the nation’s bays and estuaries. We strongly urge rejection of this title as representing a major setback for the nation’s water policy that will be both environmentally-damaging and represents an improper shift of spending and water project responsibility to the taxpayers.”\nFor more information on the 2013 WRDA see: http://www.waterprotectionnetwork.org/sitepages/downloads/WRDA_2013_NWF_Memo_EPW_Committee_3-18-13_Final.pdf\nIt is difficult to consider ourselves surrounded by nature in Miami, FL. In the city, on the interstate, or in the supermarket it is easy to think of ourselves removed from the nature of Muir’s Yosemite or Thoreau’s Walden pond. An essay called “Thirteen Ways of Seeing Nature” by Jenny Price, suggests that we reconsider how we think about nature in our city. She writes about nature in L.A., but her message applies to all cities.\nMiami is confronted with a decrepit sewage system and the problems that this system is causing for the health of our environment. Our connection to nature is real whether we recognize it or not. We must consider difficult questions like “how are we connected to the nature around us?”, “how do we affect the health of the nature around us?”, and “how do we depend on the nature around us?”. As we move into a future full of challenges like Climate Change these questions are going to become more and more important.\nI would encourage everyone to read this article by Jenny Price:\nAs Biscayne Bay Waterkeeper reflects on a successful clean-up this past week-end, it seems appropriate to consider another clean-up that happened two weeks ago.\nOn Sunday, March 3rd, Sean Bignami, was jogging on Virginia Key and came across an enormous pile of trash left over from the 9 mile music festival the night before.\nSean spoke with staff who where standing around the festival site who said they could not pick up the trash because the wind was blowing it around. Sean took pictures and videos of the scene with his phone and posted them online along with a request that people join him the next day to help clean up the area.\nFour graduate students joined Sean the following morning and picked up enough trash to fill 25 garbage bags!\nSean was unable to get a satisfactory response from the festival supervisor or the Miami parks department regarding accountability for this trash or penalties for the negligence on the part of the festival organizers.\nThe systems in place that are designed to prevent the festival from leaving piles of trash failed, and it is unclear if the festival will be held accountable. Regardless of this failure, the immediate response from concerned residents must be seen as a message to institutions who ignore the sanctity of our Bay. Biscayne Bay is home to concerned stewards, like Sean Bignami, who will not stand quietly while polluters leave trash on our shores.\nBiscayne Bay Waterkeeper wishes to celebrate the stewardship shown in this story. Thank you Sean, and all who came out to help clean up after the 9 mile festival left their trash to be blown into the Bay!\nSee the article Miami Newtimes blog posted about this story here:\nOn Sunday, March 17, 2013, Biscayne Bay Waterkeeper and Sierra Club put on a clean-up at Peacock Park in the Grove. Volunteers paddled nearby waters and gathered a huge amount of trash. Thank you to the stewards of Biscayne Bay who volunteered their time to put a dent in the amount of trash in our waters.\nThank you for a successful clean-up!\nThere is plenty of trash to pick up in Biscayne Bay.\nJoin Biscayne Bay Waterkeeper and the Sierra Club this Sunday, March 17th, for a paddle clean up at Peacock Park in the Grove (2820 Mcfarland Road, Miami, FL 33133). The clean up will start at 9 am and end at 2 pm. We will launch next to the boardwalk. Please bring your own gloves and trash bags. The Sierra club has a limited number of canoes, so we are encouraging attendees to bring their own kayaks, canoes, or paddle boards. If you do not have a boat, please contact Mark at Sierra Club to reserve a canoe. (contact Mark with any questions: email@example.com/ 305 632 7514)\n(Miami, February 28, 2013) - Samples of beach water collected at Dog Beach on Virginia Key did not meet the recreational water quality standard for enterococci. By state regulation, the Florida Department of Health is required to issue an advisory to inform the public in a specific area when this standard is not met.\nAn advisory for Dog Beach on Virginia Key has been issued because two consecutive samples collected at the beach exceeded the federal and State recommended standard for enterococci (greater than 104 colony forming units per 100ml for a single sample).\nAdditional beach water samples at the Dog Beach on Virginia Key have been collected and further results are pending.\nThe advisory issued recommends not swimming at this location at this time. The results of the sampling indicate that water contact may pose an increased risk of illness, particularly for susceptible individuals.\nThe Florida Department of Health in Miami-Dade County has been conducting marine beach water quality monitoring at 17 sites, including Dog Beach on Virginia Key, weekly since August 2002, through the Florida Healthy Beaches Program. The sampling sites are selected based on the frequency and intensity of recreational water use and the proximity to pollution sources. The water samples are being analyzed for enteric bacteria enterococci that normally inhabit the intestinal track of humans and animals, and which may cause human disease, infections, or illness. The prevalence of enteric bacteria is an indicator of fecal pollution, which may come from storm water run-off, wildlife, pets and human sewage. The purpose of the Florida Healthy Beaches program is to determine whether Florida has significant beach water quality concerns.\nFor more information please visit the Florida Healthy Beaches Program Website: http://www.doh.state.fl.us and Select “Beach Water Quality”, from the A-Z Topics List.\nWe just posted the second edition of the Paddle Out Guide. We are excited to be able to provide you with this updated material. Keep this guide close to your kayak or canoe as an aid in your exploration of our beautiful Biscayne Bay. We have posted the guide below for your convenience, but you can always find the Paddle Out Guide at bbwk.org/paddle-out. Go out and enjoy our Bay!\nThank you Julie for speaking at the Grassroots festival on behalf of BBWK\nThank you to everyone who came out to see Biscayne Bay Waterkeeper (BBWK) speak at the Sustainability Fair this weekend at the Grassroots festival!\nJulie Dick, a BBWK representative, spoke about our current projects and initiatives, helping connect the festival to some of the issues that face the Bay that surrounded the event.\nBBWK was invited to speak alongside the Center for Biological Diversity, Surfrider Miami, and the United States Green Building Council Florida Chapter. We are honored to have shared the stage with such great organizations.\nThousands of people attended the festival, many of whom camped along the water. We are happy such a festive event took place amidst the beauty of our Bay.\nVirginia Key and Key Biscayne are barrier islands which are, by their nature, exposed to the elements.\nOn February 15, 2013 the Village of Key Biscayne sent Carlos Gimenez, Mayor of Miami, a letter asking Miami-Dade County to take another look at the plans to improve the central wastewater treatment plant located on Virginia Key. Key Biscayne is concerned that the plans do not adequately consider the impacts of climate change, such as increased sea levels and stronger storm surges, and do not include funding for flood mitigation. Considering Virginia Key is a barrier island, and therefor more vulnerable to weather and flooding, makes these oversights in planning for a wastewater treatment plant on this Key particularly alarming.\nKey Biscayne supports the County’s immediate plans to address Clean Water Act outflow violations, deteriorated conditions at the Virginia Key facility, and of sewer lines identified as being at risk of rupturing, including the 54 inch under-bay line from Miami Beach to Fisher Island to Virginia Key. At the same time, the Village of Key Biscayne, situated just south of Virginia Key, is relying on the County to protect their natural environment. As long as infrastructure improvement plans do not address these long-term issues the residents of the adjacent island community of Key Biscayne will be understandably concerned for their quality of life. Key Biscayne is already plagued by foul odors from the central wastewater facility and occasional sewage spills.\nCommunity voices like key Biscayne, calling for better sewage infrastructure, are the impetus for Biscayne Bay Waterkeeper’s legal initiatives for this issue. If the County will not address the concerns of local residential and business communities, or the needs of our fragile natural resources, then legal action may be the only way we can ensure that the County properly address these issues.", "id": "<urn:uuid:2cb3abbd-7305-4de9-8d53-6b9b8e8641a0>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bbwk.org/", "date": "2013-05-23T04:54:10Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368702810651/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516111330-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9359627366065979, "token_count": 2697}, "content": [{"line": "Huffington Post released an article today that looks at the impact of sewage overflow from Superstorm Sandy in New York and New Jersey.

{"doc": {"text": "UEFA Euro 2012\n|Mistrzostwa Europy w Piłce Nożnej 2012\nЧемпіонат Європи з футболу 2012\nUEFA Euro 2012 official logo\n|Dates||8 June – 1 July|\n|Venue(s)||8 (in 8 host cities)|\n|Champions||Spain (3rd title)|\n|Goals scored||76 (2.45 per match)|\n|Attendance||1,440,896 (46,481 per match)|\n|Top scorer(s)|| Mario Mandžukić\n(3 goals each)\n|Best player||Andrés Iniesta|\nThe 2012 UEFA European Football Championship, commonly referred to as Euro 2012, was the 14th European Championship for national football teams organised by UEFA. The final tournament was hosted for the first time by Poland and Ukraine, between 8 June and 1 July 2012, after their bid was chosen by UEFA's Executive Committee in 2007. Euro 2012 set the record for both the highest aggregate attendance (1,440,896) and the highest average attendance per game (46,481) under the 16-team format (since 1996).\nThe final tournament featured 16 nations, the last European Championship to do so; from Euro 2016 onward, there will be 24 finalists. Qualification was contested by 51 nations between August 2010 and November 2011 to determine the remaining 14 finalists. The tournament was played across eight venues, four in each host country, five of which were newly built for the tournament. Aside from venues, the host nations have also invested heavily in improving infrastructure, such as railways and roads, at UEFA's request.\nThe tournament opened with a 1–1 draw between Poland and Greece at the National Stadium in Warsaw on 8 June 2012. The final match took place 23 days later on 1 July 2012 at the Olympic Stadium in Kiev, where Spain defended their title with a 4–0 win over Italy. Spain became the first team to win two consecutive European Championships, and the first international team to win three straight major tournament titles (Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012). Since Spain had already gained entry to the 2013 Confederations Cup by winning the 2010 World Cup, the runners-up Italy qualified.\nEuro 2012 was the second consecutive European Championship (after Euro 2008 held in Austria and Switzerland) in which neither of the hosts emerged from the group stage,[a] as both Poland and Ukraine were eliminated.\nBid process \nThe hosting of the event was initially contested by five bids representing seven countries: Croatia–Hungary, Greece, Italy, Poland–Ukraine, and Turkey. After an initial consideration of the bid data in 2005 by UEFA both the Greek and Turkish bids were eliminated from the process to leave three candidates. This was followed by a second round of the selection process which among other included visits by UEFA to all candidates. On 18 April 2007, the Poland–Ukraine bid was chosen by a vote of the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting in Cardiff.\nPoland–Ukraine became the third successful joint bid for the European Championship, after those of Belgium–Netherlands (2000) and Austria–Switzerland (2008). Their bid received an absolute majority of votes, and was therefore announced the winner, without requiring a second round. Italy, which received the remaining votes, had been considered favourites to win the hosting, but incidents of fan violence and a match fixing scandal were widely cited as factors behind their failure.\nThere were some later alterations from the initial bid plan, regarding the venues, before UEFA confirmed the eight host cities in 2009. During the preparation process in Poland and Ukraine, UEFA repeatedly expressed concern about their preparation to host the event, with different candidates reported as being alternative hosts if they did not improve; however, in the end, UEFA affirmed their selection.\nThe draw for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying competition took place in Warsaw on 7 February 2010. Fifty-one teams entered to compete for the fourteen remaining places in the finals, alongside co-hosts Poland and Ukraine. The teams were divided into nine groups, with the draw using the new UEFA national team coefficient for the first time in order to determine the seedings. As defending champions, Spain was automatically top seeded. The qualifying process began in August 2010 and concluded in November 2011. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage in October 2011, the nine group winners qualified automatically, along with the highest ranked second placed team. The remaining eight second placed teams contested two-legged play-offs, and the four winners qualified for the finals.\nTwelve of the sixteen finalists participated at the previous tournament in 2008. England and Denmark made their return to the Euro, having last participated in 2004, while Republic of Ireland returned after a twenty-four year absence to make their second appearance at a European Championship. One of the co-hosts, Ukraine, made their debut as an independent nation (before 1992 Ukraine participated as part of the Soviet Union). With the exception of Serbia – according to UEFA's ranking at the end of the qualifying stage – Europe's sixteen highest-ranked teams all qualified for the tournament.\nQualified teams \nThe following sixteen teams qualified for the finals:\n|Country||Qualified as||Date qualification was secured||Previous appearances in tournament1|\n|Poland||Co-hosts||18 April 2007||1 (2008)|\n|Ukraine||Co-hosts||18 April 2007||0 (debut)|\n|Germany2||Group A winner||2 September 2011||1972, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008)10 (|\n|Russia3||Group B winner||11 October 2011||9 (1960, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2004, 2008)|\n|Italy||Group C winner||6 September 2011||7 (1968, 1980, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008)|\n|France||Group D winner||11 October 2011||71960, 1984, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008)(|\n|Netherlands||Group E winner||6 September 2011||8 (1976, 1980, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008)|\n|Greece||Group F winner||11 October 2011||3 (1980, 2004, 2008)|\n|England||Group G winner||7 October 2011||71968, 1980, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004)(|\n|Denmark||Group H winner||11 October 2011||71964, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004)(|\n|Spain||Group I winner||6 September 2011||81964, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008)(|\n|Sweden||Best runner-up||11 October 2011||4 (1992, 2000, 2004, 2008)|\n|Croatia||Play-off winner||15 November 2011||31996, 2004, 2008)(|\n|Czech Republic4||Play-off winner||15 November 2011||71960, 1976, 1980, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008)(|\n|Portugal||Play-off winner||15 November 2011||51984, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008)(|\n|Republic of Ireland||Play-off winner||15 November 2011||11988)(|\n1 Bold indicates champion for that year. Italics indicate (co-)host.\nFinal draw \nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 2 December 2011 at the Ukraine Palace of Arts in Kiev, Ukraine. The hour-long ceremony was hosted by Olga Freimut and Piotr Sobczyński, television presenters from the two host countries.\nAs was the case for the 2004 and 2008 finals, the sixteen finalists were divided into four seeding pots, using the UEFA national team coefficient ranking. The pot allocations were based on the UEFA national team coefficient rankings of the sixteen finalists at the end of the qualifying competition in November 2011. Each nation's coefficient was generated by calculating:\n- 40% of the average ranking points per game earned in the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying stage.\n- 40% of the average ranking points per game earned in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying stage and final tournament.\n- 20% of the average ranking points per game earned in the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying stage and final tournament.\nAside from the coefficient, three teams were automatically placed in Pot 1. Ukraine and Poland were both assigned to Pot 1 as the two host nations, despite the fact that their rankings were the two lowest in the tournament; this also occurred in 2008 when the co-hosts Switzerland and Austria were also ranked below all other qualified teams. As defending champions, Spain were also automatically assigned to Pot 1, though their UEFA ranking at the time of the draw was coincidentally also the best.\nIn the draw procedure, one team from each pot was drawn into each of the four groups. The draw also determined which place in the group teams in pots 2–4 would take (e.g. A2, A3 or A4) to create the match schedule. With Poland were automatically assigned in advance to A1, and Ukraine to D1, Pot 1 only had two teams as Spain and the Netherlands were to be drawn into position one in either group B or C. The balls were drawn by four former players who had each been part of European Championship winning teams: Horst Hrubesch, Marco van Basten, Peter Schmeichel and Zinedine Zidane.\n1 Co-hosts Poland (coefficient 23,806, rank 28) and Ukraine (coefficient 28,029, rank 15) were automatically assigned to A1 and D1, and therefore were not in the draw.\n2 Defending champions were automatically assigned to Pot 1.\nEight cities were selected by UEFA as host venues. In a return to the format used at Euro 1992, Euro 1996 and Euro 2008, each of the four groups' matches were played in two stadiums. Host cities Warsaw, Gdańsk, Wrocław, Poznań, Kiev, and Lviv are all popular tourist destinations, unlike Donetsk and Kharkiv, the latter of which replaced Dnipropetrovsk as a host city in 2009.\nIn order to meet UEFA's requirement for football infrastructure improvements, five new stadiums were built and opened in advance of the tournament. The remaining three stadiums (in Kiev, Poznań and Kharkiv) underwent major renovations in order to meet UEFA's infrastructure standards. Three of the stadiums are categorised as UEFA's highest category stadiums. The transport infrastructure in Poland and Ukraine was also extensively modified on the request of UEFA to cope with the large influx of football fans.\nUEFA organised fan zones in the eight host cities. They were located in the centre of each city, with all 31 matches shown live on a total of 24 giant screens. The zones enabled supporters to come together in a secure and controlled environment. The Warsaw Fan Zone occupied 120,000 square meters and accommodated 100,000 visitors. In all, the fans zones had a 20% increase in capacity compared to Euro 2008.\nA total of 31 matches were played during Euro 2012, with Ukraine hosting 16 of them and Poland 15.\nBuilt for tournament\nBuilt for tournament\nBuilt for tournament\n|3 matches in Group A\n(incl. opening match),\n1 quarter-final and\n|3 matches in Group C and\n|3 matches in Group A||3 matches in Group C|\nBuilt for tournament\nBuilt for tournament\n|3 matches in Group D,\n1 quarter-final and\n|3 matches in Group D,\n1 quarter-final and\n|3 matches in Group B||3 matches in Group B|\nTickets for the venues were sold directly by UEFA via its website, or distributed by the football associations of the 16 finalists. Applications had to be made during March 2011 for the 1.4 million tickets available for the 31 tournament matches. Over 20,000 were forecast to cross the Poland–Ukraine border each day during the tournament. Over 12 million applications were received, which represented a 17% increase on the 2008 finals, and an all-time record for the UEFA European Championship. Owing to this over-subscription for the matches, lotteries were carried out to allocate tickets. Prices varied from €30 (£25) (for a seat behind the goals at a group match) to €600 (£513) (for a seat in the main stand at the final). In addition to individual match tickets, fans could buy packages to see either all matches played by one team, or all matches at one specific venue.\nAccording to UEFA requirements, TP ensured approximately 2х70 Gbit/sec data communication speed from Polish stadiums and 2х140 Gbit/sec between Poland and Ukraine. This was required due to the fact that the matches were broadcast in HD quality. The multilateral production utilised 31 cameras to cover the action on and around the pitch at every match, with additional cameras following activities around the game, such as team arrivals at the stadiums, interviews, and media conferences. The official Euro 2012 broadcasting centre was located at the Expo XXI International Centre in Warsaw. The tournament was broadcast live by around 100 TV channels covering the whole world. 150,000,000 people were expected to watch the matches each day.\nMatch ball \nThe Adidas Tango 12 was the official match ball of UEFA Euro 2012. The ball is named after the original Adidas Tango family of footballs; however, the Tango 12 and its variations have a completely new design. Variations of the ball have been used in other contemporary competitions including the Africa Cup of Nations and the Summer Olympics. It is designed to be easier to dribble and control than the reportedly unpredictable Adidas Jabulani used at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nTeam base camps \nEach team had a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches. From an initial list of thirty-eight potential locations (twenty-one in Poland, seventeen in Ukraine), the national associations chose their locations in 2011. The teams trained and resided in these locations throughout the tournament, travelling to games staged away from their bases. Thirteen teams stayed in Poland and three in Ukraine.\n|Team||Arrival||Last Match||Base camp||Group stage venues||QF venues||SF venues||Final venue|\n|Croatia||5 June||18 June||Warka\n|Gdańsk and Poznań|\n|Czech Republic||3 June||21 June||Wrocław||Wrocław||Warsaw|\n|Denmark||4 June||17 June||Kołobrzeg||Kharkiv and Lviv|\n|England||6 June||24 June||Kraków||Kiev and Donetsk||Kiev|\n|France||6 June||23 June||Donetsk||Kiev and Donetsk||Donetsk|\n|Germany||3 June||28 June||Gdańsk||Kharkiv and Lviv||Gdańsk||Warsaw|\n|Greece||3 June||22 June||Jachranka\n|Warsaw and Wrocław||Gdańsk|\n|Republic of Ireland||5 June||18 June||Sopot\n|Gdańsk and Poznań|\n|Italy||5 June||1 July||Kraków||Gdańsk and Poznań||Kiev||Warsaw||Kiev|\n|Netherlands||4 June||17 June||Kraków||Kharkiv|\n|Poland||28 May||16 June||Warsaw||Warsaw and Wrocław|\n|Portugal||4 June||27 June||Opalenica\n|Kharkiv and Lviv||Warsaw||Donetsk|\n|Russia||3 June||16 June||Warsaw||Warsaw and Wrocław|\n|Spain||5 June||1 July||Gniewino\n|Sweden||6 June||19 June||Kiev||Kiev|\n|Ukraine||6 June||19 June||Kiev||Kiev and Donetsk|\nFor the list of all squads that played in the tournament, see UEFA Euro 2012 squads.\nMatch officials \nOn 20 December 2011, UEFA named twelve referees and four fourth officials for Euro 2012. On 27 March 2012, UEFA issued the full list of 80 referees to be used in Euro 2012, including the assistant referees, the additional assistant referees, and the four reserve assistant referees. Each refereeing team consisted of five match officials from the same country: one main referee, two assistant referees, and two additional assistant referees. All of the main referees, additional assistant referees, and fourth officials were FIFA referees, and the assistant referees (including the four reserve assistant referees) were FIFA assistant referees. For each refereeing team, a third assistant referee from each country was named to remain on standby until the start of the tournament to take the place of a colleague if required. In two cases, for the French and Slovenian refereeing teams, the standby assistant referees took the place of one of the assistant referees before the start of the tournament. Continuing the experiments carried out in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League, the two additional assistant referees were used on the goal line for the first time in European Championship history with approval from the International Football Association Board.\n- Final referee; only referee assigned to four matches.\nUEFA announced the schedule for the 31 matches of the final tournament in October 2010, with the final confirmation of kick-offs times being affirmed following the tournament draw in December 2011.\nGroup stage \nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the four groups (highlighted in tables) progressed to the quarter-finals, while the bottom two teams were eliminated from the tournament.\n- Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\n- Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question;\n- Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;[c]\n- Superior goal difference in all group matches;\n- Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;\n- If two teams tie alone (according to 1–5) after having met in the last round of the group stage their ranking is determined by penalty shoot-out.\n- Position in the UEFA national team coefficient ranking system;\n- Fair play conduct of the teams (final tournament);\n- Drawing of lots.\nGroup A \nGreece were placed above Russia based on their head-to-head record (1–0).\nThe Czech Republic became the first team to win a European Championship group with a negative goal difference\nGroup B \nGroup C \nGroup D \nUkraine were placed above Sweden based on their head-to-head record (2–1).\nKnockout stage \nThe UEFA Technical Team was charged with naming a squad composed of the 23 best players over the course of the tournament. The group of eleven analysts watched every game at the tournament before making their decision after the final. Ten players from the winning Spanish team were selected in the team of the tournament, while Zlatan Ibrahimović was the only player to be included whose team was knocked out in the group stage.\nA total of €196 million was given to the 16 teams competing in this tournament, an increase from the €184 million in the previous tournament. Each team received an initial €8 million and then received additional money, based on their performances. Spain, the winners of Euro 2012, were awarded a total prize of €23 million for their performance. The maximum prize achievable (for winning all group matches and winning the final) was €23.5 million. Complete list:\nExtra payment based on teams performances:\nBesides money, commemorative plaques were given to all participants together with special plaques for semi-final losers and finalists. Gold and silver medals were awarded to the winners and runners-up, respectively, whereas both semi-final losers were awarded bronze medals. The trophy given to the winners remains in the ownership of UEFA; however, the winning nation, Spain, received a full-size replica.\nIn the final tournament, a player was suspended for the subsequent match in the competition for either getting red card or accumulating two yellow cards in two different matches. UEFA's Control and Disciplinary body has the ability to increase the automatic one match ban for a red card (e.g. for violent conduct). Single yellow card cautions were erased at the conclusion of the quarter-finals, and were not carried over to the semi-finals (so that a player could only be suspended for the final by getting a red card in the semi-final). Single yellow cards and suspensions for yellow card accumulations do not carry over to the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament matches. The following players were suspended during the final tournament – for one or more games – as a result of red cards or yellow card accumulations:\nApart from discipline measures for yellow and red cards, UEFA fined the football associations of Croatia, England, Germany, Portugal, Russia and Spain a total of €417,000 for spectators incidents.[e] Furthermore, the Portuguese association was fined €5,000 for delaying the start of the second half of the game against Germany. In addition to these, Danish striker Nicklas Bendtner was fined €100,000 and given a one match ban (to be applied in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament) for revealing his sponsored underpants, violating UEFA regulations, during the celebration of his second goal in the match against Portugal.[f]\nPenalty kicks \nNot counting penalty shoot-outs, four penalties were awarded during the tournament. Giorgos Karagounis was the only player who failed to convert his penalty, which occurred in the match against Poland.\nTrophy tour \nThe Henri Delaunay Trophy began a journey through the host cities seven weeks before the start of the tournament. A hundred days before the first match a 35.5-metre-high (116 ft) hot air balloon in the shape of the trophy was flown in Nyon, Switzerland and visited 14 cities throughout the host countries, reminding spectators of the impending tournament. On 20 April 2012, the trophy tour started and visited the Polish cities of Warsaw, Wrocław, Gdańsk, Poznań, Kraków, Katowice and Łódź. After the Polish cities, the trophy visited seven Ukrainian cities: Kiev, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Lviv, and Odesa.\nLogo, slogan and theme songs \nThe competition slogan, Creating History Together (Polish: Razem tworzymy przyszłość, literally, \"Together we are creating the future\", Ukrainian: Творимо історію разом, Tvorymo istoriyu razom), was announced along with the logo. The official logo for the tournament was unveiled at a special event at Mykhailivska Square, Kiev, on 14 December 2009. Designed by Portuguese group Brandia Central. It takes its visual identity from Wycinanki or Vytynanky, traditional form of paper cutting practised in rural areas of Poland and Ukraine. The art form symbolises the nature of the rural areas of both countries. As part of the event, landmark buildings in the eight host cities were illuminated with the tournament logo.\nThe official Euro 2012 song is \"Endless Summer\" by the German singer Oceana. In addition, UEFA has retained the melody that was composed by Rollo Armstrong of Faithless on its behalf for the 2008 tournament. The Republic of Ireland has also produced an official song: \"The Rocky Road to Poland\" recorded by a collaboration of Irish performers has already reached number 1 in Ireland. In Spain, the broadcasting company Mediaset España commissioned the song \"No hay 2 sin 3\", performed by David Bisbal and Cali & El Dandee and produced by RedOne.\nThe tournament has also been associated with the song \"Heart of Courage\" by Two Steps From Hell, which has been played in the stadiums during the entrance of the players (before the national anthems); but also \"Seven Nation Army\" by The White Stripes, in this case after every goal.\nMerchandise and mascots \nUEFA signed a worldwide licensing agreement with Warner Brothers Consumer Products to help promote the tournament. The agreement involved licensing to third parties for a variety of other merchandising items.\nAlso designed by Warner Bros. were the official tournament mascots, \"Slavek and Slavko\", twins that wore the national colours of the two host nations. The mascots were unveiled in December 2010, and named following an online poll.\nUEFA announced ten global sponsors and, for both Poland and Ukraine, three national sponsors as shown below. These sponsorships together with the broadcasting revenues were estimated to earn UEFA at least US$1.6 billion.\nConcerns and controversies \nAfter Poland and Ukraine were chosen by a vote of the UEFA Executive Committee as host countries for Euro 2012, several issues arose, which jeopardised the Polish/Ukrainian host status.\nIn Ukraine there were financial difficulties related to stadium and infrastructure renovation related to the economic crisis. In Poland, issues arose related to corruption within the Polish Football Association. In April 2009 however, the president of UEFA, Michel Platini announced that all was on track and that he saw no major problems. After a UEFA delegation visited Ukraine in September 2011, he stated the country was \"virtually ready for Euro 2012\".\nEspecially in the UK, there were allegations of racism in football in both host countries. The main cause of discussion was the BBC current affairs programme Panorama, entitled Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate, which included recent footage of supporters chanting various antisemitic slogans and displays of white power symbols and banners in Poland, plus Nazi salutes and the beating of South Asians in Ukraine. The documentary was first echoed in much of the British press, but was then attacked for being one-sided and unethical: critics included other British media outlets; anti-racism campaigners, black and Jewish community leaders in Poland; Polish and Ukrainian politicians and journalists; England fans visiting the host nations and Gary Lineker.\nIn response to Yulia Tymoshenko’s hunger strike and her mistreatment in a Ukrainian prison some European politicians and governments announced that they would boycott the matches in Ukraine.\nUkraine came under criticism from animal welfare organisations for killing stray cats and dogs in order to prepare for Euro 2012. Ukrainian Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources and Minister Of The Environment promised to take action to prevent killing animals but it still remains unclear how these measures will be enforced. The ministry's comments also suggested this would only be a temporary measure, drawing further criticism.\nOther minor important issues were associated with FEMEN’s group protests against prostitution and sex tourism in Ukraine, and enormous increases in hotel prices by many hoteliers in the country.\nSee also", "id": "<urn:uuid:0a7ef879-0b58-400b-be23-a6b28361ea76>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_2012", "date": "2013-05-23T04:58:32Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368702810651/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516111330-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.956409752368927, "token_count": 5664}, "content": [{"line": "UEFA Euro 2012", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "|Mistrzostwa Europy w Piłce Nożnej 2012", "label": "Formatting, Style, and Errors", "split": false}, {"line": "Чемпіонат Європи з футболу 2012", "label": "Formatting, Style, and Errors", "split": false}, {"line": "UEFA Euro 2012 official logo", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "|Dates||8 June – 1 July|", "label": "Formatting, Style, and Errors", "split": false}, {"line": "|Venue(s)||8 (in 8 host cities)|", "label": "Formatting, Style, and Errors", "split": false}, {"line": "|Champions||Spain (3rd title)|", "label": "Formatting, Style, and Errors", "split": false}, {"line": "|Goals scored||76 (2.45 per match)|", "label": "Formatting, Style, and Errors", "split": false}, {"line": "|Attendance||1,440,896 (46,481 per match)|", "label": "Formatting, Style, and Errors", "split": false}, {"line": "|Top scorer(s)|| Mario Mandžukić", "label": "Formatting, Style, and Errors", "split": false}, {"line": "(3 goals each)", "label": "Formatting, Style, and Errors", "split": false}, {"line": "|Best player||Andrés Iniesta|", "label": "Formatting, Style, and Errors", "split": false}, {"line": "The 2012 UEFA European Football Championship, commonly referred to as Euro 2012, was the 14th European Championship for national football teams organised by UEFA.

That's why it can be used without problems even on small or out-dated systems. It performs at least as well as the common web servers available on the market.\nAbyss Web Server features a native 64-bit edition for a maximum performance on modern systems. The installation packages contain both 32-bit and 64-bit editions.\nOn Windows, the 64-bit edition is automatically installed if a 64-bit Windows systems is detected. On Linux, the 64-bit edition is used if a 64-bit operating system is detected.\nAn intuitive web management interface called the console makes the web server configuration as easy as browsing a web site. No need to edit configuration files, the console helps you setting the server parameters in an effortless manner and can be accessed from a local or a remote computer. It is available in many languages such as English, French, Arabic, Chinese, and Spanish.\nAbyss Web Server is based on the APX architecture. APX (which stands for Anti-crash Protection eXtension) was created, here at Aprelium, to make the server crash-proof. If it happens that the software causes a critical error and crashes (which is by the way very improbable), a report will be generated if possible and the server is automatically restarted. The downtime in such a case won't exceed 1 second!\nSecurity is the #1 priority in Abyss Web Server. In addition to its advanced URL decoding engine which rejects malicious and suspicious requests, it features an efficient anti-hacking system which detects at an early stage hacking attempts or denial of service attacks and bans dynamically their originating IP addresses.\nIt is also equipped with an anti-leeching system to automatically prevent other web sites from directly linking to your images or files.\nAbyss Web Server supports the standard eXtended Server Side Includes directives to help you create dynamic HTML pages with the least effort and without requiring the use of a scripting language. Advanced directives such as #if, #elif, #else, #endif, and #set are available to enable flow control as well as variables setting and substitution constructs.\nAbyss Web Server supports the automatic compression of its responses when it dialogs with modern browsers which understand HTTP compression. This contributes to the reduction of bandwidth consumption and makes your sites load faster for most of your visitors.\nAbyss Web Server supports file names and URLs written in any human language.\nAbyss Web Server features a native support for ASP.NET 1.1 as well as 32-bit and 64-bit editions of ASP.NET 2.0, 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5 on Windows NT, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, Home Server, 2008, 7, 8 and 2012. You can install your ASP.NET applications and ASPX files and start serving them immediately with no performance loss and no incompatibilities issues.\nAbyss Web Server's ASP.NET support is not limited in anyway and can execute small test scripts written in C# or VB.NET as well as large applications which use the advanced capabilities of ASP.NET such as custom web controls, database access, authentication, web services, XML processing, MVC, AJAX, or RIA/Silverlight.\nAbyss Web Server has been specially designed to make using scripts the simplest possible even on Windows platforms.\nThanks to its CGI and ISAPI extensions interfaces, Abyss Web Server supports various scripting languages such as PHP, Perl, \"Classic\" ASP, Python, Ruby, Rebol, and TCL.\nLanguages which interpreters are FastCGI-compatible (such as PHP) will even experience a significant processing speed boost on Abyss Web Server while reducing in the same time your system load.\nWhether you are going to test a simple script or install and run a complex database-driven web application, Abyss Web Server is the best choice in terms of ease of configuration and optimal performance.\nAbyss Web Server can act as a reverse proxy to provide content transparently from another Web server behind it (commonly called a back-end server.) The proxied server can be another Web server or an application server with a restricted or even a trivial HTTP support that has to be shielded from external clients.\nReverse proxying is also the recommended way to take advantage of JSP (Java Servlet Pages) and Tomcat/Jetty Web applications.\nAbyss Web Server can run Web applications based on the Ruby on Rails framework. Their execution speed will be optimal thanks to the use of the FastCGI interface.\nInstalling Ruby on Rails has also been made easy on Abyss Web Server: clear instructions and full Ruby + Ruby on Rails packages are provided to make deployment of the framework quick and straightforward.\nYou can configure the total bandwidth that Abyss Web Server is allowed to use when answering the requests. You can also configure the bandwidth that is allowed for every visitor.\nFiner bandwidth control is also available in Abyss Web Server X2 and can be used to configure the allowed bandwidth per file, per directory, or per group of files or directories.\nPassword protecting files or directories has never been easier. You can define users and groups of users and create advanced access rules with a few clicks.\nWith Abyss Web Server, you have a total control over the layout and the look and feel of your directory listings. You can define a template using simple SSI directives or you can write in your preferred programming language your custom directory listing script.\nAbyss Web Server can serve more than one web site from the same computer. This is often called virtual hosting or support for multiple hosts. Each defined host has its specific configuration and is completely independent from other hosts. Virtual hosting is only available in the professional edition Abyss Web Server X2.\nAbyss Web Server supports the SSL and TLS protocols and is able to accept secure connections with strong cryptography (up to 256-bit keys) to protect your visitors' sensitive data from flowing in clear form over the Internet. SSL/TLS support enables you to host E-commerce sites and accept credit card data with the highest level of security available in today's industry standards.\nDeclaring, self-signing, and requesting SSL certificates has never been easier. With Abyss Web Server, you have not to use external tools and type lengthy commands to generate keys, certificates, and CSRs. Every task related to SSL certificates can be carried out using the console (the remote Web configuration interface).\nHave you ever wondered how to have the same site available with http:// and https:// URLs at the same time? With Abyss Web Server, such a setup only requires an extra click when declaring your host. You can even configure it to serve some parts of the site (for example login protected areas) only with https://. In such a case, Abyss Web Server will handle automatically the redirection from the http:// to the https:// URL. Dual hosts support is only available in the professional edition Abyss Web Server X2.\nAbyss Web Server supports both IPv4 and IPv6 Internet protocols for a maximum interoperability with both legacy and modern networks.\nAbyss Web Server includes a URL rewriting engine conforming to industry standards. It can help you hide the complex URLs of your Web applications and make them look more user friendly.\nAlthough URL rewriting is usually considered as an advanced feature, it remains easily controllable in Abyss Web Server through the comprehensible user interface of the console.\nAbyss Web Server can be configured to act as a Windows System Service, MacOS X Startup Item, or Linux daemon. In such a case, you do not have to start it manually. It will be automatically launched immediately after your computer startup, even though no user is logged in, and will operate in the background.\nYou do not need to be a system wizard to make Abyss Web Server operate in this mode. A few clicks (on Windows and MacOS X) on a comprehensible dialog window are sufficient.", "id": "<urn:uuid:adc6a260-b20f-4570-b2ab-fffcfc3793a3>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.aprelium.com/abyssws/features.html", "date": "2013-05-23T04:41:38Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368702810651/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516111330-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.8990506529808044, "token_count": 1668}, "content": [{"line": "Abyss Web Server Features", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Compact, easy to use and fully compliant to standards", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Abyss Web Server is a compact web server available for Windows, MacOS X and Linux operating systems.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Low requirements for great performance", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Abyss Web Server does not require huge memory or excessive computing power to run.
