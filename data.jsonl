{"doc": {"text": "So yeah, I really like the basic ideas behind using stats for a noble house as backdrop. But I think there's some flaws in the system. Specifically:\n-Houses scale from 10-70 on resources, with linear increase in strength of holdings, while the curve should rather be exponential.\n-Because of this influence and status often does not properly reflect the material holdings that these are based on.\nTo begin with, I'll nail down some definitions:\n-Rank is where the house stands compared to others, where 0 is a peasant family and 70 is that of the mightiest great house. I'm leaving the King out of it, because the Iron Throne generally does not hold direct command over as many resources as say Highgarden or Casterly Rock.\n-Resources is used to buy holdings, like current rules, and are derived according to the formula: Resources=Rank*Rank/10.\n-Holdings as current, but with modified costs.\nNote; I am not going to present a final product, not yet anyway, the separation of rank and resources could result in a fair bit of unbalance. And I'm mostly interested in getting my general ideas out at this point. The system will also most likely lead to that player created houses perhaps becomes slightly stronger. Don't get caught up too much in the specific numbers presented.\nChange number one: Status and Influence.\nThe Influence resource is no longer used to buy status for heirs. It is used for buying house status:\nKnightly House: 10, status 2\nPetty Noble House: 40, status 2\nMinor Noble House: 160, status 3\nMajor Noble House: 250, status 4\nGreat Noble House: 360, status 5*\n*Requires the Iron Throne to approve. As there can only be one great house per realm. Though arguably, a \"vassal house\" might reach the status of being \"great\" if the paramount house also holds the title of warden (House Hightower probably is the closest to qualify as such).\nHouse status works in the way that it determines what kind of status members may purchase. The Lord, his spouse, their children and their spouses can buy up to the listed amount. First cousins have the listed amount -1. Second cousins have the listed amount -2. Children of First cousins have the listed amount -2. And so on. Castellan, steward and master at arms has the listed amount -1, Sworn swords the listed amount -2. It will never go below 2.\nWith this comes amended benefits:\nLanded Knight, requires Knightly House: +1D to all status tests.\nLord of House, requires noble House: +2D to all status tests.\nLady of House, requires noble House: +1D to all status tests.\nHeir, requires noble House: +1D to all status tests.\nWarden (of the North, south, east or west): +3D to all status tests.\nMember of the Small Council: +3D to all status tests\nHand of the King, Regent: +4D to all status tests\nYou only get the highest bonus, and I'd generally advise that characters being appointed Hand of the King swaps out his lord benefit with hand of the king benefit, or whatever it is he has.\nThe Influence rank, in my opinion, should be have two components:\n1. Base influence rank is the average value of your rank in defense, lands, power and wealth.*\n2. The Influence modifier, which is a number between 0 and rank/5 which is either added or subtracted.**\n*Without more in depth rules for Law and Population than a modifier on house fortunes, I don't really want to factor them in.\n**This is what will be rolled during house creation, which will be influenced by events and realm. Probably, this will mean that you don't make the 7d6 roll for influence at all.\nFor expansion, I would suggest introducing \"House Qualities\" benefits which would cost rank*10 resources and drawbacks that would give rank*10 resources. For example:\nAll members of the House gets +1B on Status reputation.\nAll members of the House gets -1D on status reputation. (I imagine the Freys have taken this one).\nThis could maybe be done for other types of resources also.\nWhile it would be fun, I'm not going to look into law/population, they have no holdings associated with them.\nChanges to holdings:\nDefense, here, resource inflation needs to have a corresponding increase in holding cost, so without much further ado:\nSmall Castle: 90\nLarge Castle: 250\nSuperior Castle: 360\nExtraordinary Castle: 490\nYou could skip the latter two steps, but IMO, Harrenhaal is so much bigger than Winterfell that I think they should be there for the sake of completeness.\nFor Land Holdings, I wouldn't change much, the core idea of mine is that a house with 70 of something has a lot more than 7 times than a house with 10 of the same thing. A house of 70 of something has like 50 times as much now.\nExcept for communities, which I would increase in cost along the lines of what I did with castles above.\nPower would be much the same, but with the add-on that the cost of a banner house is equal to it's power rank. A Banner House with 50 power (with banner houses and units worth 250 resources) costs 50 resources.\nWealth is the tricky part, you'll run out of options fairly quick, to mitigate this, you could increase prices, introduce more diverse holdings. Or maybe make it so that every holding you buy increases the cost of any further holdings. Say, the price of a new holding is increased by 1 for each wealth holding you already have.", "id": "<urn:uuid:92b681d5-6c93-409d-9bec-7f41c5b71cc3>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.greenronin.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=104626", "date": "2013-05-24T01:44:26Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368704132298/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516113532-00001-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9534624218940735, "token_count": 1215}, "content": [{"line": "So yeah, I really like the basic ideas behind using stats for a noble house as backdrop.

In particular, this invention relates to a method and system for collecting and transmitting video record rental data to a processing device at a remote location for revenue-sharing purposes.\nIn the business of renting video tape records of movies, distributors such as motion picture studios normally sell the tape cassettes at relatively high prices to the rental stores. As a result, the rental store owners are required to make a relatively large capital investment in order to buy enough tapes to meet their customers' needs. Often the owner can not afford to purchase the quantity of video tapes required to satisfy the demand. The result is that both the distributors and the rental stores lose revenues, and some members of the public do not get the opportunity to rent the movie of their choice.\nIn response to these problems, video tape revenue-sharing rental methods have been proposed and developed. In one such method, a video tape store owner may obtain a video tape from a studio or other distributor for a relatively small initial cost. Thereafter, each time the video tape is rented, the distributor receives a certain percentage of the rental income. After a video tape has been rented a certain number of times, or after a predetermined time period has passed since the video tape was first offered for rent, the video tape may be offered for sale to the public and the proceeds divided between the store owner and the distributor.\nAll parties benefit from such an arrangement. The public has more copies of a movie available to rent, the store owner can reduce the amount of capital tied up in the tapes, and both the store owners and the distributors earn more revenues from the added rentals. This may induce the motion picture studios to release movies on video tape much sooner, or even simultaneously with the movies' release to theaters, so that a greater portion of the public can enjoy the movies sooner and at a lower cost.\nThe above-described rental method preferably is carried out by a computer system such as that shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,029,034, issued Jul. 2, 1991, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,050,031, issued Sep. 17, 1991. Both of those patents are assigned to the assignee of the present patent application.\nThe system shown in those patents is highly advantageous; it enables the transmission of rental data from many different retail rental store terminals to a central computer or processor. This system computes the shares of video rentals earned by the retailers and distributors, prepares reports regarding rental transactions, and otherwise handles the accounting for the transactions electronically, as it is described in greater detail in those patents.\nThe system shown in those patents has the advantage that the speed and cost of collecting rental data is greatly improved. If desired, \"counting cassettes\" also can be used to count the number of plays of a video record by the customer, and the rental charge can be based on the number of plays.\nIn one known commercial system using one embodiment of the invention shown in those patents, all of the transaction data including rental and sale information of each store is transmitted to the central computer from each rental terminal. A problem with that arrangement is that many stores sell other products such as sweatshirts, candy, etc. in addition to renting or selling video records. Therefore, the video record business forms only a portion of the business of many rental stores. This is particularly true where the store is one which primarily sells other merchandise, such as supermarkets, department stores, etc. Therefore, there is a substantial amount of data which must be sorted out from the record rental information. This sorting should be done in the stores before the transmission of data to the central computer to prevent overloading the central computer equipment, thus increasing its cost, and also increasing the cost of data transmission and processing. For this reason, special features presently are required in the software used in the rental store to sort the extraneous data out before transmission to the central computer. Without such features, the software is incompatible with that of central computer.\nAnother problem is caused by the diversity of different point-of-sale computers and software which are used by video record retailers. Only a relatively few of the software packages have been modified to make them compatible with the central computer. Therefore, in order for retailers to participate in the revenue-sharing program, they often are required to buy relatively expensive compatible software to replace that which they already have. Also, they are required to re-train their employees to use the new software.\nAnother problem exists even with rental stores which have compatible software in that they may not have a compatible local area network operating software.\nAnother problem is that some rental stores do not have any computerized point-of-sale equipment at all. Therefore, even the smallest rental store is forced to acquire relatively sophisticated and expensive computer equipment in order to be able to participate in the revenue-sharing plan.\nIn either of the foregoing circumstances, the relatively high cost of acquiring new computer hardware and/or software is a significant deterrent to participation in the revenue-sharing plan.\nAccordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide equipment and methods for merchandise distribution data processing which overcomes or substantially alleviates the foregoing problems.\nMore specifically, it is an object of the present invention to provide equipment and methods for use in video record revenue-sharing which significantly reduce the cost of entry into the revenue-sharing plan.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a data collection system and method which can be used with a wide variety of computers and software without significant modifications.\nIt also is an object of the invention to provide a relatively low-cost and compact point-of-sale input terminal.\nThe foregoing objects are met by the provision of a data collection means and method, operating on signals used to display data in the local computers, to collect data for transmitting to a central computer. In a specific embodiment of the invention, the data is video record rental and sale data from retail distribution locations.\nIf desired, the rental data is segregated from that relating to the sale of other merchandise, and the data for revenue-sharing rentals is identified so that it can be further segregated by the central computer. Alternatively, if desired, the revenue-sharing data can be segregated locally so that only it will be sent to the central computer. Optionally, the revenue-sharing data can include pay-per-play data developed by the use of play-counting cassettes.\nThe invention is capable of segragating rental transaction data from sales transaction data. Additionally, revenue-sharing rental transaction data can be segregated from non-revenue sharing data. Further, if desired, sending of transaction data to the central computer can be controlled on a product or title ID basis.\nSelecting data from that used by display devices in the local point-of-sale (\"POS\") systems has the advantage that the data collection equipment used can be largely standardized and need not be customized to be compatible with each of the multitude of hardware and software systems now used as point-of-sale equipment. The data sent to the display device (display screen or printer, e.g.) almost always is in ASCII code. Therefore, a device responsive to that code will be useable with almost all such equipment.\nThe invention includes a method for integrating into a data processing network, POS equipment which has incompatible software. A display data analyzing device is connected to the POS equipment to separate out and transmit to the central computer the data desired. Since the original POS equipment and software need not be changed, the cost of entry into the revenue-sharing plan is reduced significantly.\nDisplay data sent to the display screen and/or printer of the usual POS system is formatted by the system software so that predetermined data usually appears in a predetermined location on the screen and/or printed invoice, or receipt or other business form. In the present invention, advantage is taken of this fact to provide a relatively fast, inexpensive means for selecting data.\nThe data is selected on the basis of its location on the display. Preferably, this is done by forming movable outlines of variable size on the display and capturing any data which falls within the outlines. In addition, recognition marks are placed on the display to identify that display as one which contains data to be captured; for example, data pertaining to the rental or sale of video records.\nAdvantageously, the recognition marks and the location and size of the windows can be varied individually in each POS system, either locally by relatively simple manipulations of the POS system controls, or by a command downloaded from the central computer. Thus, each data collection device may be customized to accommodate the individual needs of the POS system. Moreover, this can be done by an ordinary installer who need not be a computer programmer.\nChanges made in the data collection system or POS system after installation similarly can be accommodated easily. For example, if the retailer decides to start renting play-counting tape cassettes such as those described in the above-identified patents, and therefore must capture data indicating the number of plays, the changes in the data capture procedures can be made relatively quickly and inexpensively.\nA novel small-footprint data entry terminal is provided to reduce the cost and size of the POS equipment used by the retailer.\nThe small-footprint terminal has a keyboard with substantially less than a full complement of alphabetic character entry keys. Preferably, the keyboard has no such keys; rather, it has numerical keys and dedicated but programmable keys for entering specific data relating to video record transactions. This saves the cost and space required for a full keyboard, and makes the recording of a transaction faster and simpler.\nPreferably, the small footprint terminal has a relatively small display using segmented elements, for example, dot matrix elements, to form the characters. A two-line, forty-character, LCD display is preferred. This small display provides all the display capacity needed, while saving the space and cost of a large video display.\nThe small-footprint terminal is operated as a slave from an ordinary personal computer used as a master in a local area network.\nOther objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be set forth in or apparent from the following detailed description and drawings. In the drawings:\nFIG. 1 is a block diagram of a video record rental revenue-sharing system constructed in accordance with the present invention;\nFIG. 2 is a schematic, partially perspective drawing of one embodiment of the point-of-sale system of the invention;\nFIG. 3 is a schematic, partially perspective view of another embodiment of the point-of-sale system of the invention;\nFIGS. 4A, 4B, 4C-1, 4C-2, 4D-1 and 4D-2 comprise flow charts for computer programs utilized in the invention;\nFIGS. 4E, 4F, 4G, 4H, 4I and 4J represent respective screens which may appear on a CRT display;\nFIGS. 5 and 6 are schematic, partially perspective views of further embodiments of the point-of-sale system of the invention;\nFIG. 7 is a schematic circuit diagram of a \"data tap\" or collection device constructed in accordance with the invention;\nFIG. 8 is a block diagram of the circuitry of a small footprint data entry terminal (\"SFT\") constructed in accordance with the invention;\nFIG. 9 is a schematic circuit diagram of a LAN adapter constructed in accordance with the invention; and\nFIG. 10 is a perspective view of the small-footprint data entry terminal (\"SFT\") whose circuitry is shown in FIG. 8.\nFIG. 1 shows a video tape record revenue-sharing distribution system 10 constructed in accordance with the present invention. FIG. 1 is schematic and shows only a small part of an actual system which typically would be used commercially.\nThe system 10 includes a central computer or processor 12 which communicates with a point-of-sale (\"POS\") system in each of a large number of individual video record retail stores. Only three such stores, Stores No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 are shown in FIG. 1, by way of example.\nThe POS equipment in Store No. 1 is conventional prior art equipment. It comprises a local area network which includes a personal computer 14 used as a server. The server 14 uses programming compatible with that of the central computer. Also included are two slave terminals T1 and T2. The server or PC 14 is connected to a dial-up modem 13. The server 14 through the use of the modem 13 periodically calls up the central computer 12 and transmits accumulated rental transaction data for the store to the central computer over telephone lines 31, which if it is a long distance call would preferably be through one of the long distance systems such as \"Tymnet\", \"Sprint\", \"MCI\" or \"AT&T\". Alternately, the central computer 12 may periodically call up the modem and cause it to transmit the accumulated rental transaction data for the store to the central computer over the telephone lines.\nThe central computer or processor 12 processes the data it receives by first separating the data regarding revenue-sharing cassettes from all of the other data it receives. Then, it computes the shares of the revenues due to the cassette owners or distributors and to the retailers. Reports and funds are sent to the respective participants in the revenue-sharing program according to a formula previously agreed upon. If desired, reports can be transmitted through a modem 30 and telephone lines to computers such as S1 -S4 at the places of business of the cassette owners. Alternatively, reports can be sent by ordinary mail or telecopier, etc.\nPayments from the retailers can be made by conventional means, or by means of electronic fund transfer banks B1, B2, B3, etc., as it is more fully described in the above-identified patents. Payments can be made to the entity owning and operating the system 10, which then pays the cassette owners and retains its share of the revenues.\nAs it is indicated in FIG. 1, many other stores in the revenue-sharing system communicate over other telephone lines 34 with the central computer 12. Each of those other stores can have point-of-sale equipment and software such as that shown in one of Stores No. 1, 2 and 3, or other combinations shown herein, or in any other desired combination.\nThe point-of-sale (\"POS\") system in Store No. 1 includes, in addition to the modem 13, server 14 and terminals T1 and T2, a cash drawer 15 or 17 for each terminal T1 or T2, and a printer 16 which is connected to one of the terminals T1 and T2 to print receipts and other matter in the normal transaction of retail video store business.\nEach terminal has a bar-code reading wand 18 or 19 to read bar-coded product identification numbers and other product data into the terminal. A credit-card reader (not shown in Store No. 1) often is used with each terminal.\nThe server 14 also can be used as a sales terminal, and can have its own cash drawer, bar-code reader, credit card reader and printer, if desired.\nThe server can have local area network (\"LAN\") adapter equipment, file servers, and other equipment used in a local area network. Each terminal T1, T2 usually has a video display screen, a keyboard, hard disc and/or soft or floppy disc drives, etc., as in conventional personal computers.\nOf course, if only one sales terminal is needed, the PC 14 can be used, together with a printer, wand, cash drawer, etc., as the only input terminal.\nIf needed, further terminals can be added, as indicated by the dashed line 20.\nAs it has been stated above, point-of-sale systems like the one in Store No. 1 are in widespread use in video stores throughout the United States and elsewhere in the world. However, in order for such systems to operate with the central computer 12, the software they use must be compatible with that used in the central computer. Specifically, the software should segregate the video record transactions from the others into separate files which may be then transmitted to the central computer in pre-defined data record formats. Further, video record titles which are used in the store are matched to the standard titles as defined by the central computer.\nOnly a few of the software packages designed for video rental store use have been modified to be compatible with the central computer software in the known revenue-sharing system in the U.S.A., the one which is operated by Rentrak Corporation. Therefore, the owners of many stores having point-of-sale computer equipment are forced to buy expensive compatible software and re-train their employees to use the new software in order for the retailer to participate in the revenue-sharing program. This is daunting and creates a substantial impediment to the growth of revenue sharing and its benefits.\nStore No. 2 has exactly the same point-of-sale equipment as store No. 1 except that its software is not compatible with that of the central computer 12. However, it has been adapted, in accordance with the present invention, to be operable with the central computer 12 without replacing the incompatible software already in use.\nIn accordance with the present invention, three novel devices called \"data taps\" 22 are used together with a LAN adapter card 21, a master PC 25 and software stored in the server 14, terminals T1 and T2 and in the master PC 25. Each data tap 22, as will be described in greater detail below, separates the information regarding video record rentals from the data which is sent to the printer or the display screen of the terminals T1 or T2 or the server 14, and sends the information to the master PC 25 which stores the information until it is transmitted through the modem 13 to the central computer 12.\nThe three data taps 22 are connected together in series in a \"daisy chain\" sequence. There is one data tap for each terminal T1, T2, etc. and for the server 14 in the POS system.\nFIG. 3 is a partially perspective schematic view of an adapted POS system 60 which is the same as that used in Store No. 2 of FIG. 1, except that the terminal T2 and the server 14 are not shown, and only one data-tap 22 is used.\nThe server 14 and each terminal T1, T2, etc. is a separate personal computer whose software is not compatible with that of the central computer. The LAN adapter card 21 and modem 13 shown in Store No. 2 of FIG. 1 are inside the master unit 25 and are not visible in FIG. 3.\nAs shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, each respective data tap 22 is connected to the terminals T1, T2 and the server 14, and is further coupled through the LAN adapter 21 to the master computer 25. One of the data taps, for example, the data tap connected to terminal T1 is also connected to the printer 16. The data tap 22 is adapted to receive and temporarily store all data displayed on the display screen of the terminals T1, T2, and data to be printed on the printer 16. The captured data is thereafter supplied through the LAN adapter to the master computer.\nA \"TSR\" program disc 52 is shown in FIG. 3. As it will be described in greater detail below, the TSR program is used in each terminal T1, T2, etc. to facilitate data selection and processing in accordance with the invention.\nApplicants have taken advantage of the fact that, regardless of the brand of the computer, data which is sent to the display screen or display device such as the printer 16 consistently is in ASCII code. Therefore, the hardware of the data tap can be standardized so that one type of device can be used with a wide variety of computer hardware and software.\nThis is highly advantageous. It minimizes hardware and software costs and facilitates modification of existing POS systems to lower the cost of entry into the revenue-sharing plan. Also, the store employees need not be re-trained to use new software, because they can simply continue to use the software with which they are familiar. This minimizes any business interruption which might be caused by entry into the revenue-sharing plan.\nStore No. 3 of FIG. 1 is an example of a store that has no computer equipment to start with. Since such a system has no incompatible software, compatible software can be used from the very start. However, since it might be a major expense to the store owner to purchase a prior point-of-sale system simply for the purpose of enrolling in the revenue-sharing plan, applicants have provided hardware with minimum cost and size so that the store owner's investment is kept to a minimum.\nIn particular, the system in Store No. 3 includes a master PC 25, a LAN adapter 27, a printer 16 and cash drawers 15 and 17. Also included are optional credit card readers 28 and 29, as well as bar code reader wands 18 and 19.\nIn accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, the POS system also includes two simple, low-cost data input \"Small Footprint Terminals\" (\"SFT's\") 23 and 24. The small footprint terminals will be described in greater detail below.\nWith the use of the small footprint terminals, if needed, and the advantageous software of the present invention, the store owner of Store No. 3 can install a system which will keep track of inventory, and all sales transactions, and also will automatically separate out the data for video record transactions and transmit it through a modem over a telephone line 32 to the central computer, all at a relatively modest cost.\nFIG. 2 is a partially perspective view showing an integrated POS system 40 like that used in Store No. 3 of FIG. 1, except that only one SFT terminal 23 is used instead of two.\nThe master computer 25 is a conventional personal computer such as one made by IBM, or an IBM compatible personal computer. It has a full keyboard 42, a video display screen 44, an internal hard-disc drive (not shown), and a floppy-disc drive whose input port is shown at 46.\nThe master computer 25 is programmed to be compatible with the central computer 12. It also is programmed to perform the data capture functions similar to those previously described with reference to the data tap 22.\nIn addition, certain other features are provided by the software, as it will be described below.\nThe printer 16 is a standard dot-matrix, ink-jet, laser or other printer connected to the printer port of the computer 25.\nThe cash drawer 15 is conventional, as is the credit card reader 28 and the bar-code reader 18.\nThe modem 26 and the LAN adapter card 27 of FIG. 1 are physically located inside the housing of computer 25 and are not visible in FIG. 2.\nThe small footprint terminal (\"SFT\") 23 is a compact, relatively inexpensive data entry terminal with a keypad 50 and a two line LCD display 148, each line having 40 characters. The SFT 23 will be described in greater detail below, and is shown enlarged and in its preferred form in FIG. 10.\nEach of the master computer 25 and the SFT can be used at a separate check-out counter or station in the store. Another SFT can be added for each other station in the store.\nActually, the cash drawer 15, bar-code reader 18, card reader 28, the LAN adapter card, and the SFT 23 are not absolutely necessary to enable a store without a computer to participate in the revenue-sharing plan. The store only needs to acquire a master computer 25 with the compatible software described herein, and a modem and a printer.\nAs it is explained in the above-identified patents, most video tape cassettes bear information which is in both human-readable and bar-code form identifying the title of the work, a serial number for the cassette, etc. The bar-code reader 18 can be used to read this information into the computer 25 quickly. However, the store clerk can input the same information by means of the keyboard 42. Other products sold in the store also have similar identification information which is entered into the master computer 25. If one or more SFT terminals is included in the system, each such terminal can be used to enter the same information into the computer 25.\nThe computer 25 preferably is programmed to provide functions other than simply entering sales and rental data. For example, it can be used to order video tapes from an on-line revenue sharing catalog which may be periodically downloaded from the central computer 12. Additionally, the computer 25 provides information useful in operating the video tape rental store, including lists of video tape rentals by title, over-due video tapes, current video tape inventory, purchase order status, etc.\nOther functions which can be performed by the master computer 25 are described in the above-identified patents.\nThe SFT 23 communicates with the master computer 25 by way of a local area network (LAN) which is implemented using the LAN adapter card 27 (FIG. 1). By way of this communication, the SFT 23 is able to receive price or other information from data bases stored in memory in the computer 25. Upon completion of each business transaction, the SFT 23 transmits the information relating to the transaction to the computer 25, which processes the information, and may cause the printer 16 to print an appropriate record of the transaction, such as an invoice.\nThe master computer 25 separates the data regarding rentals or sales of video records from other information, stores the video record data, and, at a predetermined time, transmits it to the central computer 12. The cassette identification numbers for revenue-sharing cassettes are known and can be identified by the central computer 12 to compute revenue shares. If preferred, only the revenue-sharing cassette rental information is collected, stored and transmitted to the central computer.\nThe computer 25 through the use of the modem 26 periodically calls up the central computer 12 and transmits accumulated transaction data for the store to the central computer over telephone lines 32, which may be one of the long distance systems previously described with reference to telephone lines 32. Alternately, the central computer may sequentially dial the telephone numbers assigned to each of the master computers in the separate stores in the system 10 at respective predetermined times, and cause the stored revenue-sharing data to be transmitted from each computer through its modem. Previously-stored orders placed by the store for revenue-sharing tapes also are transmitted to the central computer by this means.\nThe central computer 12 also transmits data to each master computer 25 in the system while it is connected to it. By this means, the central computer transmits updates to the catalog of available revenue-sharing properties, and other communications to each store. It also can transmit re-programming instructions to each local POS system.\nAlthough the cash drawer, barcode reader, printer and credit card reader are connected by cables to the master computer 25, the SFT 23 also has receptacles in the rear panel (not shown) into which those devices could be connected, if it is more convenient to do so.\nEach SFT terminal 23 is specially adapted for use as a POS terminal. Therefore, extraneous features needed in a general-purpose computer are not included. By this means, the cost of each SFT is minimized. This reduces the cost of the POS system in a store requiring more than one sale terminal.\nFIGS. 5 and 6 show other examples of adapted POS systems; that is, existing POS systems which are not compatible with the central computer 12 but have been adapted to be compatible without replacing the existing software.\nFIG. 5 shows an existing POS system which includes a personal computer 202 used as a file server, work stations 208 and 210, and printers 212 and 213. Work stations 208 and 210 communicate with the server 202 by way of a conventional local area network package such as that sold under the trademark \"NOVELL\" by Novell, Inc, or \"LANTASTIC\", by Artisoft, Inc. Each package includes software and LAN adapter hardware. To adapt such a POS system to be compatible with the central computer 12, there is added a master computer 25, software programs, data taps 204, 205 and 206, the LAN adapter hardware and a modem (not shown) in the master computer.\nAs it is shown in FIG. 7, as well as FIG. 5, each of the data taps has a serial input port 230, a serial output port 232, and parallel ports 240 and 242 to allow the data tap to be connected to other equipment through either serial or parallel ports, as the equipment might require.\nEach data tap also includes a LAN input connector 236 and a LAN output connector 238.\nThe master computer 25 is connected through cable 220 to the data tap 204 through LAN input terminal 236. Data tap 204 is connected through port 238 and cable 223 to the next data tap 205, which is connected to data tap 206 through cable 225. The three data taps thus are connected together in \"daisy chain\" fashion. This facilitates adding further data taps and workstations at the end of the \"daisy chain\", as the store and the POS system grow.\nThe server 202 is connected to the data tap 204 through the cable 221 and the parallel input port 240. Similarly, the printer 212 is connected to the data tap 204 through parallel port 242.\nEach of the workstations 208 and 210 and the server 202 may be a full personal computer with a video display 246, a full keyboard 248, and may have a hard disc drive and/or a floppy disc drive 250. Each of these units 202, 208 and 210 has both serial and parallel ports and can be connected to the data tap through its serial input port 230. As an example, workstation 210 is connected to parallel port 240 of data tap 206 through cable 226.\nPrinter 213 is connected to parallel port 242 of data tap 206 through a cable 227.\nThe printer 212 is connected to serve both the server 202 and the first workstation 208. Printer 213 serves the second workstation 210. If desired, a separate printer can be provided for each data entry station.\nIt should be understood that the LAN adapter 21, modem 13, cash drawer, bar code readers, etc. shown in store No. 2 of FIG. 1 have been omitted from FIG. 5 for the sake of clarity. However, the POS system will include the adapter and modem, and usually will include the other items as well.\nA program disc 214 is shown above each of the server 202 and the two workstations in FIG. 5 to indicate that a TSR program is stored in the unit and is used in the manner to be described below.\nThe POS system shown in FIG. 5 continues to use the software already used in the pre-existing LAN, and thus avoids the need to purchase new software and re-train employees to use the new software. The master computer 25 and data taps 204-206 operate independently, with compatible software, to gather and transmit the data needed for participation in the revenue-sharing plan.\nA POS system utilizing a UNIX operating system as illustrated in FIG. 6. The existing POS system includes a UNIX server 302, slave data entry terminals 304 and 306, and printers 308 and 310. To adapt such a POS system for use with the revenue-sharing system shown in FIG. 1, a master computer 25 and three data taps 312, 314 and 316 are utilized. The master computer 25 is connected to the data taps via cables 320, 325 and 327 in a \"daisy chain\" sequence like that shown in FIG. 5.\nThe connection of the terminals 304 and 306 to the server 302 is similar to that described above and shown in FIG. 5, except that, in the UNIX POS system, a separate cable 323 or 324 connects each slave terminal 304, 306 to the server. Accordingly, each data tap is connected between the server and one of the terminals, through cable 326 or 330.\nWhen a printer is connected to a server or terminal, additional parallel connections are used. For example, printers 308 and 310 are respectively connected to the parallel ports of the data taps by cables 322 and 330 and from there to the server 302 and terminal 306 by way of the cables 321 and 329.\nA program disc 303, which bears a program which is substantially similar to the TSR program 214 of FIG. 5, is loaded into the UNIX server 302 so as to enable the server to capture data displayed on the display screen of the server and/or sent to the printers and to supply such data to the respective data taps.\nEach of the terminals 304 and 306 is a so-called \"dumb\" terminal; that is, it is a terminal having limited processing capabilities, and which depends on the server to process the data input at the terminal and define the display on the screen of the terminal.\nThe master computer 25 communicates with the data taps 312, 314, and 316 in a manner substantially identical to that previously described with reference to FIG. 5.\nThe computer programs used for data selection and storage are highly advantageous.\nIn general, a \"teacher\" program is used to create stored \"templates\" and \"trapper\" routines in each POS system.\nThe \"templates\" are routines for recognizing data appearing in predetermined locations on either a display screen or a printed invoice. The locations are set to match the specific formats used for invoices and/or screen displays in each store.\nIn an integrated system which has no data taps, the template(s) is or are stored in the master computer 25, (which also may be the only computer, in the smallest POS system).\nIn POS systems using data taps, the templates can be stored in the data taps, to save computer storage capacity, or in the master computer 25, or in the smart terminals of a system such as that shown in FIG. 5 or in the servers such as those shown in FIGS. 5 and 6.\nThe \"trapper\" routines which are created by use of the \"teacher\" program use the template(s) to separate and identify data to be stored and sent to the central computer 12. The \"trapper\" routines are stored in the master computer 25, and also may be stored in smart terminals or servers.\nIn the trapper routines, a unique combination of characters called \"landmarks\" is used to distinguish each type of display from the others. When a display is identified as one containing desired data, that data is selected by use of a template, stored in the master computer, and eventually uploaded to the central computer.\nThe \"teacher\" program is a program which is stored in the master computer, smart terminals and servers. It can be used by authorized personnel, such as an installer, to create the templates and trapper routines in a given POS system.\nThe templates for use with display screen data are created, in the manner to be discussed in detail below, by forming outlines or windows around specific areas of the screen, and enabling the detection of data when it appears in the windows.\nIf the data is selected from that which is transmitted to the printer to print business forms such as invoices, and if the data appears on the display screen on the computer 25, etc., in the same format as on the printed form, then the same technique can be used in establishing the template(s) as when screen data is used.\nHowever, if the format of the data displayed on the screen does not match that of the printed data, a different technique is needed. For example, the invoice can be placed on a digitizer tablet, and the areas of the invoice from which data is selected can be outlined by the use of a digitizing pen.\nPreferably, however, the data tap is programmed to have a \"pass-through\" mode in which data, for example, invoice data, is simply passed through to the master computer and stored on disc. Then the data for a typical invoice is put in the location required by the invoice, and pased through to the master computer, recalled, and displayed on a terminal screen. The data capture areas then are set to cover the areas occupied by the displayed data.\nIn either case, regardless of whether screen data or printer data is analyzed, the trapper program works in substantially the same way to detect and select data to send to the central computer 12.\nThe trapper and teacher routines are \"terminate and stay resident\" (TSR) routines; that is, routines which are able to run in a computer at the same time another portion of the main program is being executed.\nThe trapper and teacher programs will now be more fully described with reference to FIGS. 4A, 4B, 4C-1, 4C-2, 4D-1 and 4D-2. In this description, as an example, it is assumed that the programs are used in the terminal T1 of store no. 2 of FIG. 1.\nThe trapper program is initiated at step S10 of FIG. 4A.\nProcessing then proceeds to step S20 in which a determination is made as to whether the trapper program has already been loaded. This determination prevents multiple copies of the trapper program from being executed. That is, if the trapper program has already been loaded, as indicated by a \"Yes\" at step S20, an indication representing that the trapper program has already been loaded is displayed and further processing is terminated, as indicated by steps S21 and S22, respectively.\nIf, on the other hand, the trapper program has not already been loaded, as indicated by a No at step S20, processing proceeds to step S30. At step S30, processing associated with the existing or \"old\" clock subroutine is redirected so as to include processing of an additional or \"new\" clock subroutine. This new clock subroutine is initiated by a clock interrupt signal which typically occurs at a rate of 18 times per second, and will be more fully described later. Processing then proceeds to step S35.\nAt step S35, the template file for the trapper program is read. The template file resides on disc in the terminal and contains a template which previously was created by use of the teacher program, as it will be described below.\nAt step S40, the status of the trapping process is set. At this time, data is not being trapped. Flags may be utilized for indicating the trapping status. For example, a \"0\" flag may be set at step S40 to indicate a \"trapping nothing\" status. Processing then proceeds to step S50.\nAt step S50, an indication that the trapper program has been properly loaded is supplied to the display screen of the terminal T1 so as to notify the operator. Thereafter, the trapper program is placed in a \"terminate and stay resident\" (TSR) mode as indicated in step S60.\nUpon the occurrence of a clock interrupt signal, processing of the new clock subroutine is initiated in step S70 and then proceeds to step S80. At step S80, a determination is made as to whether the new clock or old clock subroutine is currently being executed. If the determination at step S80 is affirmative, processing proceeds to step S110. At step S110, the processing returns to the old clock subroutine, so that the normal processing of the application software is continued.\nIf, on the other hand, the new clock subroutine is not currently being executed, as indicated by a \"No\" at step S80, then processing proceeds to step S90. At step S90, the \"trapper\" subroutine is executed. The trapper subroutine of step S90 is shown in detail in FIG. 4B.\nReferring now to FIG. 4B, the trapper subroutine starts at 125 and proceeds to step S130, in which a flag is detected, if it is present, indicating that video cassette rental data was being selected or \"trapped\" during the previous interrupt cycle. If the determination in step S130 is affirmative, processing proceeds to a series of steps S131-S134 for determining when the data on the terminal screen has changed, and for saving cassette rental data.\nAt step S131, a determination is made as to whether the previously selected \"landmarks\" have changed. \"Landmarks\" are selected certain portions of the data displayed on the terminal screen during the processing of video cassette rentals. They are unique in terms of their content and/or their location on the screen. Any screen having these marks is identified as a screen containing video cassette rental data.\nIf the recognition marks have changed, as indicated by a Yes at step S131, processing proceeds to step S132. At step S132, a \"trapping nothing\" flag is set for the next interrupt cycle. This indicates that the display has changed and that the next display must be tested to see if it has cassette rental or return data.\nWhen the landmarks have changed, this indicates that the screen being displayed has changed, and the next screen must be tested to determine whether or not it is one which has rental or return data. After step S132, processing proceeds to step S133, in which the data saved from the areas of the display selected by the template is sent to an output buffer. Thereafter, processing proceeds to step S170, wherein processing exits the trapper subroutine and returns to step S100 in FIG. 4A, where one packet of data is sent to the output port of the data tap or computer in which the program is operating.\nIf, however, the landmarks have not changed, as indicated by a No at step S131, processing proceeds to step S134. At step S134, the rental information which has been trapped is saved, updated during subsequent interrupt cycles, and ultimately sent to the output buffer at the end of the display. Thereafter, processing returns to step S100 to wait for the next interrupt cycle.\nIf the determination in step S130 is negative, processing proceeds to step S140. At step S140, a determination is made as to whether the selected information pertains to the return of video cassettes to the store after a rental. If the determination in step S140 is affirmative, processing proceeds to steps S141-S144, which are the same as steps S131-S134 except that they are performed for return data rather than rental data.\nIf the determination in step S140 is negative, meaning that neither a \"trapping returns\" or \"trapping rentals\" flag has been set, processing proceeds to step S150. At step S150, a determination is made as to whether landmarks have been detected which match. This comprises the first identification of the display as one having video cassette rental data. If there is such a match, as indicated by a Yes at step S150, then rental data is trapped and stored in the memory at step S151. Thereafter, at step S152, a \"trapping rentals\" flag is set to indicate that video cassette rental data is being trapped, and the process returns to step S100 in FIG. 4A to await the next interrupt cycle.\nIf, on the other hand, there is not a match of video cassette rental landmarks, as indicated by a No at step S150, then processing proceeds to step S160. At step S160, a determination is made as to whether cassette return landmarks have been detected. If there is such a match, as indicated by a Yes at step S160, then processing proceeds to steps S161 and S162, whereupon processing identical to that of steps S151 and S152, respectively, is performed, except that a \"trapping returns\" flag is set up and return data is saved.\nIf there is not a match of video cassette return landmarks, as indicated by a No at step S160, then processing returns to step S100 in FIG. 4A.\nThe trapper routines are repeated once for every clock interrupt signal, which has a frequency of 18 interrupt cycles per second.\nWhen each new display is created, it has neither a \"trapping rentals\" flag nor a \"trapping returns\" flag. The display is first identified as one containing data to be saved in step S150 or S160. Thereafter, during each subsequent interrupt, since the status flag has been set at step S152 or S162, the determination of step S130 or S140 is affirmative. As a result, processing proceeds to step S131 or S141 so as to determine if the landmarks have changed. If the landmarks have not changed, thereby indicating that the same screen is still being displayed, video cassette rental information continues to be trapped and saved.\nThe next time in which the trapper subroutine is executed, since the status flag set in step S152 or S162 has not changed, the determination at step S130 or S141 is again affirmative. Processing then proceeds to step S131 or S141. At this point, assume that the display screen has changed. The determination at step S131 or S141 is then affirmative. Since the screen has changed, video cassette rental information is no longer being trapped and, as such, the status flag is set accordingly at step S132 or S142. All of the trapped video cassette transaction information, which had been saved at steps S151, S161, S144 and S134, is supplied to the output data buffer of the terminal at step S133. Processing then proceeds to step S170.\nReferring again to FIG. 4A, the data stored in the output data buffer at steps S133 and S143 at the termination of a screen is supplied by way of the output parallel printer port of the terminal T1 to the data tap 22, or are sent directly to storage in the master computer 25, in a system having no data tap. Since only a certain limited amount of data can be transmitted during each interrupt cycle, one packet of data is transmitted during each cycle until all of the data has been transmitted. By transmitting the data in this manner, a slowdown of the POS processing is not noticeable. The data waiting to be transmitted is stored in memory, for example, the RAM, of terminal T1.\nPrior to transmitting this data, a unique character or characters are added at the beginning and the end of the data stream. These characters provide a means for the data tap 22 to distinguish between data which is trapped as a result of the trapper program from data to be printed by the printer 16. That is, upon detecting these unique characters, the data tap is alerted that the data identified by the unique characters is trapped data to be sent to the master computer, and is not to be printed.\nAfter step S100, processing proceeds to steps S110 and S120 as previously described.\nReferring now to FIGS. 4C-1 and 4C-2, the \"Teacher\" program is initiated at step S210. Thereafter, processing proceeds to the determination step S220. The processing performed in steps S220, S230 and S240 is substantially similar to that of steps S20, S21 and S22, respectively, and therefore will not be further described.\nIf the teacher program has not already been loaded, as indicated by a No at step S220, processing proceeds to step S250 in which the signals produced by pressing the keys on the keyboard of the terminal T1 are modified or \"redirected\" in a \"new keyboard\" routine.\nSubsequently, in step S260 a template file is loaded from disc into memory. This template file may be a default file as, for example, represented by the windows located on the right side of screen No. 4. Alternatively, the template file may be one that had been previously modified, and may be similar to that represented by the windows shown in screen No. 6.\nAfter step S260, in step S270, an indication that the teacher program has been loaded successfully is displayed. Thereafter, the program is placed in a terminate and stay resident mode (TSR) at step S280.\nStep S290 is initiated to bring the target application onto the screen. Because teacher is not active, the new keyboard, as in the step S300 routine, executes the old keyboard function. In step S310, the application responds in a normal manner to a key press. In step S320, a determination is made as to whether the key pressed terminates the application. If not, the loop formed of steps S300, S310 and S320 are repeated as the application responds to each key press. Once the desired screen is brought to the display, so-called \"Hot Keys\" are pressed and the teacher is activated.\nThe \"new keyboard\" portion of the teacher program utilized for creating the trapper template will now be described.\nReferring now to FIG. 4C-2, the new keyboard routine is initiated by a key press. As previously mentioned, while the teacher is not active and prior to a hot key press, the old keyboard routine is executed in step S350 and processing then proceeds through steps S360 and S370 to step S450, which completes the routine. Once the hot key is pressed, while the teacher is inactive, step S350 executes the old keyboard routine. Processing then proceeds through step S360 to step S370, whereupon the hot key press is detected.\nAt step S380, a status indication or flag is set indicating that the teacher program is active. Thereafter, processing proceeds to step S390, in which an initial status indication or flag is set indicating that neither landmarks nor data areas are currently being set or learned. Processing then proceeds to step S400, in which the currently displayed application screen is saved in a memory of the terminal T1. Thereafter, processing proceeds to the teacher subroutine of step S410.\nThe teacher subroutine of step 410 is expanded as shown in FIG. 4D.\nReferring now to FIGS. 4D-1 and 4D-2, the processing of the teacher subroutine starts at step S460 and proceeds to step S470. At step S470, the installer may select a key from the displayed main menu. As an example, in the preferred embodiment, selecting the \"Alt\" and \"1\" keys initiates processing of the trapper template for the video cassette rental landmarks and data, whereas selecting the \"Alt\" and \"2\" keys initiates processing of the trapper template for the video cassette return landmarks and information data. After selection of the key or keys in step S470, processing proceeds to step S480.\nAt step S480, a determination is made as to whether the escape key has been pressed by the installer. If the escape key has been pressed, as indicated by a Yes at step S480, processing proceeds to step S482.\nAt step S482, a determination is made as to whether areas for either rental or return landmarks and data are being set or learned. If the determination in step S482 is affirmative, processing proceeds to step S484. At step S484, the status indication or flag is set to indicate that neither rental or return information is being learned. Thereafter, processing returns to step S470. If, however, the determination at step S482 is negative, processing proceeds to step S486, whereupon the teacher subroutine is exited and processing is returned to step S420. Thus, after the learning processing has been initiated as described later, the escape key needs to be pressed twice in order to exit the teacher subroutine.\nIf, on the other hand, the escape key has not been pressed, as indicated by a No at the Step S480, processing proceeds to step S490. At step S490, a determination is made as to whether the key(s) selected in step S470 initiates learning of the video cassette rental landmarks and data information. That is, in the preferred embodiment, were the \"Alt\" and \"1\" keys selected in step S470.\nAs an example, assume that the \"Alt\" and \"1\" keys were selected in step S470. As a result, the determination in step S490 is affirmative. Processing then proceeds to step S492 in which areas to be used for landmarks and data information are displayed as well as functional information used for identifying the landmarks and data information. Processing then proceeds to step S494, in which the status indication or flag is set to indicate that rental landmark or data information areas are being set. Thereafter, processing returns to step S470, for selection of key from those identified in the sub-menu.\nProcessing then proceeds through steps S470 and S480 to step S490. At step S490, since a key from the sub-menu was selected in step S470 and not the learning rental or \"ALT\" and \"1\" keys, processing proceeds to step S500. Similarly, processing proceeds through step S500 to step S530.\nAt step S530, a determination is made as to whether the learning of rental landmark and data information areas is currently being performed. If the determination in step S530 is affirmative, processing proceeds to step S540. In this situation, since the flag was set in step S494 indicating that rental learning is being performed, processing proceeds to step S540. At step S540, the landmark and data areas are selected. These areas may be selected by using, for example, cursor locating or arrow keys (\u2191, \u2190, \u2193, \u2192) to move shaded areas to the desired positions, thereby forming a rental template. After completing this rental template, processing returns to step S470.\nSince the rental template is completed, processing proceeds from step S470 to step S480, whereupon the escape key is selected. Thereafter, processing proceeds to step S482. Since the flag set in step S494 still indicates that rental landmark and data information areas are being learned, processing proceeds to step S484.\nAt step S484, the flag is reset to indicate that rental learning is no longer being performed. Thereafter, processing returns through step S470 to step S480. Upon pressing the escape key again, processing now proceeds through step S482 to step S486, thereby exiting the teacher subroutine.\nIf landmark and data information areas pertaining to video cassette returns had been desired, the \"Alt\" and \"2\" keys would have been selected initially at step S470. In this situation, the processing of steps S500, S510, S520, S550 and S560 would have been performed. Since the processing performed in these steps is substantially the same as that performed in steps S490, S492, S494, S530 and S540, respectively, they will not be described further.\nReferring again to FIG. 4C-2, after the teacher subroutine ends, as indicated at S420, the landmark and data information areas are saved in a file entitled the \"template file\" in memory. Then, as indicated at S430, the application screen saved at step S400 is displayed.\nProcessing then proceeds to step S440 where the flag initially set in step S380 is changed to indicate that the subroutine is no longer active. Processing is then returned to the application software at step S450.\nIf the new keyboard is called while the teacher is active, processing proceeds through steps S340, S350 and S360 to completion at step S450.\nThe following description illustrates the operation of the teacher program. Sample display screens are reproduced for use in the description. The screens were produced using a data format produced by an existing POS program. This illustrates how the invention easily can be used with a variety of existing video retail store software packages.\nIn the interest of brevity, the following description will be limited to the use of the teacher program to set landmark and data capture areas for video record rentals only, with the understanding that the teacher program also can be used for video record returns and sales, etc. Similarly, the teacher program may also be used in the rentals, returns and sales of non-video record items.\nUpon loading the teacher program into the memory of the terminal T1 or other computer, display shown in Screen 1 illustrated in FIG. 4E appears on the CRT display.\nNext, a display for use in renting video records is selected, and screen 2 illustrated in FIG. 4F appears.\nThe information appearing on screen No. 2 illustrated in FIG. 4F will now be described, beginning at the top of the screen and proceeding to the bottom.\nThe top line of Screen No. 2 includes an invoice number for the rental transaction, the time and date, and the term \"CAP\". The invoice number displayed in this example is No. 1. The time and date represent the time and date of transaction. The \"CAP\" term indicates the lock function of the keyboard.\nThe second line from the top of Screen 2 includes identification of the cashier/drawer, the customer file number and \"items out.\"\nThe cashier/drawer entry identifies the cashier operating the terminal or workstation or the cash/drawer being used with the terminal or workstation.\nThe customer file number allows tracking of customers between different stores of the same chain.\nThe term \"items out\" indicates the current number of video cassettes and video players which this customer has not as yet returned.\nThe third line from the top of Screen 2 includes a sales person identification number, customer identification, and total rentals.\nThe sales person identification is entered into the terminal or workstation by the sales person and stored in memory prior to initiating any business transactions. The customer identification may be in the form of a number, and the customer's name and/or phone number. In this situation, the customer identification is \"1 J. Smith\".\nThe total rentals (TOT RENTS) indicates the number of rentals which this customer has rented over a predetermined time period. In this situation, this customer has previously rented one video cassette during the last week.\nThe fourth line of Screen 2 includes the term \"DAYS OUT\", \"MEMBERSHIP FEE\" and \"CREDITS DUE\".\n\"DAYS OUT\" refers to the rental period and is typically set by the store owner. In this particular example, the store owner has set the standard time period for the rental of a video cassette to be one day.\nThe \"MEMBERSHIP FEE\" term indicates the total expenditure paid by the customer for his or her membership in the video store club. In this example, since the customer is not a member (as indicated by the pricing type \"O\") the customer has not paid anything towards a membership fee.\nThe \"CREDITS DUE\" term refers to a credit in terms of a number of free rentals which may be owed to the customer. In the example shown, the customer is not owed anything.\nThe fifth line from the top of Screen 2 includes the terms \"DAYS CHARGE\", \"MEMB PRICING TYPE\" and \"ITEM NUMBER\".\nThe \"DAYS CHARGED\" term refers to the number of days charged to the customer for the video cassette rental. As with the previously described \"DAYS OUT\" term, the charge is set by the video store owner. In this example, since the video cassette is rented for one day, the number of days charged for also is 1. If, however, the customer were to rent a video cassette on a Saturday evening and the store were to be closed on the next day, a Sunday, the \"days out\" term would indicate 2, but the \"days charge\" term would still be 1.\nThe \"MEMB PRICING TYPE\" term stands for \"membership pricing type\". This indicates one of four pricing classifications in which the customer has been placed. As an example, the store owner may provide discount memberships to senior citizens or full-time students, and so forth.\nThe ITEM NUMBER term is the actual identification number of the item being rented or purchased. As previously described, this item may be entered by use of the bar code wand 18 to read it off of the tape cassette being rented, or by use of the keyboard of the terminal or workstation. While the item number is being entered, the number appears on the line to the right of the colon (:). Upon entering a valid item number, the number to the right of the colon is omitted and the number is placed in parenthesis as shown to the left of the colon.\nThe sixth line from the top of Screen 2 includes the headings \"NO.\", \"DESCRIPTION\", \"RSCF\", \"DAY O\", \"DAY C\", \"CHARGE\", \"DUE DATE\", \"DUE TM\" and \"A/P\".\n\"NO\" is a number assigned to the item which is being sold or rented, and corresponds to the above-described item number. More specifically, upon entering the item number from the fifth line, the number corresponding to this item number, which is stored in the database of the master computer, is recalled and displayed. In this example, the number in the master computer's database corresponding to the entered item number of the fifth line is 1001.\nThe \"Description\" column provides a description of the item being rented or sold. In this situation the item is a movie, as indicated by the term \"MOV\", and is entitled Gone With The Wind.\nThe RSCF column refers to the type of the transaction. That is, \"R\" indicates a rental, \"S\" indicates a sale, \"C\" indicates a credit and \"F\" indicates a free transaction, such as for a free replacement.\nThe \"Day O\" column indicates the number of days which this movie is rented for, which, in this example is one day.\nThe \"Day C\" column indicates the number of days for which the customer is to be charged for this rental which in this situation is one day.\nThe \"Charge\" column indicates the cost of the rental.\nThe \"Due Date\", \"Due Time\" (TM) and A/P columns indicate the day and time in which the video cassette is to be returned. In this example, the cassette is to be returned no later than 4:00 pm on Sep. 24, 1991.\nThe eighth line of Screen 2 includes membership pricing type (MEM TYP) and account balance (ACT BAL).\nThe membership pricing type is identical to that displayed on the fifth line and is merely redisplayed at this location.\nThe account balance indicates the outstanding balance which the customer owes. In the example shown, the balance is 0.\nThe ninth line of Screen 2 includes total rentals (\"TOTAL RENT\"), membership fee (\"MEMB FEE\") and sub-total.\nThe total rentals is the amount charged for all video cassette rentals for the current transaction, which in this example is $7.00.\nThe membership fee indicates the amount towards a membership which the customer is currently paying. In this situation, the customer is not paying anything towards his or her membership fee.\nThe sub-total indicates the amount of total rentals, sales and miscellaneous charges prior to any applicable sales tax.\nThe ninth line from the top of Screen 2 includes \"TOTAL SALE,\" \"SALES TAX\" and \"NOT-RESERVED\".\nThe \"TOTAL SALE\" indicates the total amount of video cassette sales, and thus lists sales separately from rentals. The sales tax entry is self-explanatory.\nThe \"NOT RESERVED\" message appears indicating that the cassette being rented was not previously reserved by the customer. If the cassette is rented at the same time as it was reserved for, and if the customer renting the cassette is the one who reserved it, a \"MATCH\" message will appear. If the same customer reserved it for a different time, a \"SEMI-MATCH\" message appears.\nThe eleventh line of Screen 2 lists miscellaneous charges (\"MISC CHRGS\"), \"TOTAL\" and [Esc]=END.\nThe miscellaneous charges indicate the non-video cassette items such as candy, cigarettes, etc. which have been purchased.\n\"TOTAL\" is the grand total of the current transaction, including tax.\nThe [Esc]=END prompt reminds the operator that upon completing the transaction the \"ESC\" key is to be pressed to end the transaction.\nThe last two lines on Screen 2 list the function keys F1 through F10 and their respective functions.\nF1 and F2 move the cursor to be moved in an upwardly or downwardly direction, respectively, inside the area of the screen dedicated to the transaction information. That is, these keys, in combination with the keyboard, allow the operator to edit a line.\nFunction keys F3 and F4 may be used by the operator to enter a Days Out and a Days Charge which may be different from that set by the store owner.\nKey F5 informs the terminal or workstation that a check-in or video cassette return is to be entered. By pressing function key F5, the screen is changed to a screen for handling the returns of video cassettes.\nThe customer key F6 is used to modify the customer number/name or phone number of the third line.\nThe total key F7 is used to calculate a re-total. The miscellaneous or function key F8 is used to enter price information for miscellaneous items, such as popcorn, etc.\nPressing function key F9 allows the cursor to move to the portion of the screen containing the No., description, RSCF, Day O, etc., terms.\nUpon pressing the function key F10 the transaction currently displayed on the screen is aborted.\nIn accordance with the present invention, upon pressing the \"hot keys\" on the keyboard, that is, the \"Alt\" and the left \"shift\" keys, the main menu of the teacher program is displayed in the shaded area at the bottom of the display as shown in Screen 3 illustrated in FIG. 4G. The main menu allows the installer to select processing for either \"rentals\" or \"returns\".\nBy pressing the \"Alt\" and \"1\" keys, the operator displays the sub-menu of the teacher program for rentals in the shaded area at the bottom of the display as shown in Screen 4 illustrated in FIG. 4H.\nThe sub-menu in Screen 4 includes ten terms which are used for identifying the landmarks and the data capture areas.\nTerms LM1, LM2 and LM3 are used for identifying three landmarks. Similarly, the next seven terms are used to identify rental transaction data, that is, the invoice No. (\"Inv\"), customer (\"Cust\"), type of transaction (\"Type\"), the number of days desired to rent the video cassette (\"Qty\"), volume identification or the number of the volume (\"Vo Id\") of the item being rented or sold, title of the video cassette (\"Title\") and the price or charge for the rental or sale (\"Price\").\nAlso displayed on the right side of the screen is a row of 10 rectangular shaded areas, each of which corresponds to one of the 10 terms displayed in the sub-menu. The top-most shaded area is reserved for landmark No. 1, the next shaded area below is for landmark No. 2, and so forth, down to the bottom shaded area which is for the price data. The operator can move the shaded areas and change their sizes to cover the desired landmark and information areas as described below with reference to Screens 5 and 6.\nAny of the terms in the submenu in Screen 4 can be selected by pressing \"ALT\" plus one of the keys 0 to 9 on the keyboard. When this is done, Screen 5 illustrated in FIG. 4I appears.\nEach of the shaded areas on the right side of the screen can be moved to a desired location to cover the area where certain data appears. The shaded areas can be moved by using the cursor or arrow keys (\u2191, \u2190, \u2193, \u2192). The size of each area can be modified by using the \"Shift\" key together with the desired arrow key.\nThe technology for creating, moving and enlarging these areas is well known in the art and will not be described here. For example, such technology is utilized in a number of word processing programs which are commercially available.\nAs shown in Screen 5, the areas containing the \"INVOICE NUMBER\", \"CASHR/DRAWER\" and \"NO. DESCRIPTION\" have been selected as the three landmark areas. This has been done by moving the three uppermost shaded areas in Screen 4 to the left, as shown in Screen 5.\nThese three areas were selected because collectively they contain data which is unique to the rental screen in terms of content and location. Therefore, later, during use of the \"trapper program\", if each of the terms \"INVOICE NUMBER\", \"CASHR/DRAWER\" and \"NO. DESCRIPTION\" is detected in these landmark areas, then the screen being displayed is identified as a rental screen from which data is to be saved for transmission to the central computer 12.\nScreen 6 illustrated in FIG. 4J is the same as Screen 5, except that the data capture areas have been fully defined.\nThe manipulative steps involved are illustrated by the following example.\nThe operator presses the \"Alt\" and the \"4\" keys to activate the fourth shaded area from the top in the right portion of Screen 4. Then, this capture area is moved by use of the arrow keys so as to cover the \"1\" following the \"INVOICE NUMBER\" term on the top line of the screen. This area then is reduced in size, by using the \"SHIFT\" and the arrow keys, as it has been described above, so as to cover only the area reserved for the invoice numbers.\nSimilarly, the other data capture areas are moved and re-shaped to cover the customer number, the type or RSCF column, the quantity or days out column, the volume identification No. column (i.e., the column entitled \"NO.\"), and the title and the price or charge column.\nLater, during operation of the \"trapper\" program, the data in these seven data captures areas is saved for later transmission to the central computer 12.\nThe pattern of data capture areas shown in Screen 6 is referred to in this patent application as a \"template\".\nUpon completing the template for the video cassette rentals, the operator presses the ESCAPE key. As a result, the teacher program exits from the sub-menu and returns to the main menu display shown in Screen 3 above.\nUpon pressing the ESCAPE key a second time, the operator restores the rental screen normally displayed by the application software, Screen 2 which is shown above.\nThe teacher program can be used in the same manner to set or adjust the landmark and data capture areas for other screens, such as for returns, etc.\nFIG. 7 is a block diagram of the data tap 22. The data tap includes a microcontroller 102, a memory segmentation and selection circuit 104, a programmable serial I/O circuit 112, a parallel I/O circuit 116, a local area network (LAN) I/O circuit 120 and a data, address and control bus 110.\nThe data tap 22 is connected to the master computer 25 by way of the LAN I/O circuit 120 and a cable as shown above in FIG. 5 or FIG. 6, etc. (not shown in FIG. 7). This allows communication between the master computer and the data tap. In a preferred embodiment, both transmitted and received communications are differentially driven by utilizing RS-422 or RS-485 interfaces. The use of these interfaces allows effective communications over relatively large distances. That is, an RS-422 or RS-485 interface allows effective communication up to a length of approximately 5,000 feet, whereas a standard RS-232 interface typically restricts the effective length of a communication path to only about 50 feet. The LAN I/O circuit 120 is preferably configured so as to allow \"daisy chain\" connections between multiple terminals or work stations, as described above, and as it will be described in greater detail below.\nThe parallel I/O circuit 116 includes two parallel ports 240, 242 in which one of the ports 242 is adapted to function in a bi-directional manner as either an input or an output port. This bi-directional port 242 is connected to the printer, 212 as shown in FIG. 5. The other port 240 may be connected to a terminal, a server computer or a workstation, also as shown in FIG. 5.\nThe programmable serial I/O circuit 112 contains a dual universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (Dual UART) integrated circuit. This I/O circuit has two serial interface ports 230, 232, in which one of the ports 232 is connected to a POS terminal and the other port 230 is connected to its server computer, for example, a Unix server, as shown in FIG. 6.\nThe microcontroller 102 is adapted to control the data processing functions performed by the data tap. As an example, the microcontroller may be an 8-bit microcontroller such as model no. MC68HC11A1 manufactured by the Motorola Corporation. This microcontroller is limited to controlling 64 k-bytes of data, which is entirely adequate for the task.\nThe memory segmentation and selection circuit 104 includes a EPROM 106 and a RAM 108. This circuit is adapted to apportion areas of the EPROM and RAM as required. Since the preferred microcontroller is limited to controlling 64 k-bytes of data, the total available memory in the EPROM and RAM is also limited to 64 k-bytes, As a result, in a preferred embodiment, the EPROM has 32 k-bytes of memory capacity in which 8 k-bytes are available and the RAM has 64 k-bytes of memory capacity in which 56 k-bytes are available. The RAM is adapted to receive an operating program from the master computer 25 and to store the same within its 56 k-bytes of available memory. A boot code program is stored within the 8 k-bytes of available memory in the EPROM. Predetermined subroutines may also be stored in the EPROM.\nA power supply 122 receives power from an external power source, for example, a 115 V., 60 Hz outlet, and transforms the 115 V. power to 5 Vdc which is used to power the data tap 22. Alternatively, the power supply may be configured so as to receive other input power which, for example, may be 230 V., 50 Hz, or other power available in other countries.\nA unique serial number circuit 114 is provided. It includes an integrated circuit and is adapted to generate a unique 48-bit number. This unique number is supplied via the bus 110 and the LAN I/O circuit 120 to the master computer 25. The master computer supplies this 48 bit number to the central computer 12. Alternatively, this number is replaced with a smaller unique number, for example, an 8-bit number, which may be supplied to the central computer. This number provides a means for identifying the data tap and the corresponding POS station.\nAs an example, the central computer can identify a malfunctioning POS station to the store owner through use of the unique identification number. Further, in the event that a POS station is disconnected, either intentionally or unintentionally, the central computer can identify the disconnected POS station by use of the identification number.\nThe data, address and control bus 110 provides a means for a controlled data transfer between the microcontroller 102, memory segmentation and selection circuit 104, programmable serial I/O circuit 112, unique serial number circuit 114, parallel I/O circuit 116, LEDS 118 and 119 and LAN I/O circuit 120.\nWhen power is applied to the data tap 22 from the power supply 122, the boot code program stored in the EPROM 106 is executed by the microcontroller circuit 102. As a result, the main operating program is downloaded from the master computer 25 into the RAM 108. The microcontroller then executes the program which was recently stored in the RAM. The subroutines stored in the EPROM may be addressed during execution of the main program.\nAs previously described, the data tap 22 is connected between a printer and a data entry terminal by way of the parallel I/O circuit 116. Further, the data tap is coupled to the master computer 25 by way of the LAN I/O circuit 120.\nAs it has been indicated above, a data template can be used to capture data either from the data displayed on the screen of the input terminal, or from the data sent to the printer to prepare a printed record of the transaction.\nAssuming that printer data is to be captured, printer data is sent from the input terminal to the data tap, where the data is temporarily stored in the RAM 108. While the data to be printed is temporarily stored in the RAM, the data tap executes the trapper routine so as to determine if the data to be printed contains relevant video record transaction information. As an example, if this determination indicates that the document to be printed is an invoice, then data appearing at specific locations, will be captured. That data typically includes the invoice number, the video title, etc. The data captured is temporarily stored in the RAM and later is transmitted to the master computer for storage until it is uploaded to the central computer.\nThe stored data also is supplied through the parallel I/O circuit 116 to the printer in a regulated manner. Therefore, the data tap also functions as a data buffer for the printer.\nIf it is screen data which is being captured, and if the POS system uses a data tap, the captured or trapped data is sent to the data tap where it is temporarily stored. By detecting the unique character or characters which are placed at the beginning and the end of the trapped data by the trapper program, the data tap is able to distinguish trapped data from data which is to be printed. This prevents the trapped data from being mistakenly supplied to the printer and then printed. The data temporarily stored in the data tap is subsequently supplied to the master computer 25.\nThe master computer repeatedly polls all of the data taps in a POS system in sequence to determine if they have data to be transmitted to the master computer. If a data tap has any such data, the master computer signals the data tap to transmit it. The data is transmitted in separate data packets, one for each polling cycle, as it is commonly done in computer networks.\nStill referring to FIG. 7, light-emitting diodes (\"LED's\") 118 and 119 are used for providing information relevant to the operation of the data tap 22 to the operator. The activation of the green LED 119 indicate that the master computer is attempting to communicate with the data tap. The activation of the red LED 118 indicates that the data tap is properly communicating with the master computer.\nAdditionally, the LED's 118 and 119 are utilized for fault isolation or error detection by causing the LED to blink.\nFIG. 10 is a perspective view of the small footprint terminal (\"SFT\") 23, and FIG. 8 is a block diagram of the circuitry of the SFT. The SFT 23 also is shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.\nThe SFT, as shown in FIG. 10, includes a housing 500 with an upper surface 501. A display 148 and a keypad 50 are located on the upper surface 50.\nThe SFT circuit shown in FIG. 8 includes a microcontroller 140, a memory segmentation and selection circuit 142, the display 148, a keypad controller 150, the keypad 50, a data, address and control bus 154, a programmable serial I/O circuit 156, a parallel I/O circuit 162 and a LAN I/O circuit 164.\nThe memory segmentation and selection circuit 142 includes an EPROM 144 and a RAM 146. Circuit 142 controls the configuration of the EPROM 144 and RAM 146. In a preferred embodiment, EPROM 144 contains 64 k-bytes of which 8 k-bytes are available and RAM 146 contains 64 k-bytes of which 56 k-bytes are available. A boot-up program is stored within the EPROM 144.\nPreferably, the microcontroller, EPROM, RAM, I/O circuits, power supply and memory control circuits are the same as in the data tap 22 so as to take advantage of standardization as much as possible.\nThe display 148 is adapted to display operator requested data. The display also may provide the operator with other useful information. For example, in the event that network communications with any of the master computer 25, the printer 16, the bar code reader 18, the credit card reader 28 or the cash drawer 15 are interrupted, an error message will be displayed. To aid during the installation of the system, installation messages may be displayed. Further, if the printer runs out of paper or if input data is in an incorrect format (e.g., the data does not contain the required number of numerals), an error message will be displayed. Furthermore, prompts to assist in the use of the credit card reader and the cash drawer also may be displayed.\nReferring now to FIG. 10, as well as FIG. 8, the display preferably is a two-line by 40 character wide reflective dot matrix liquid crystal display (\"LCD\"). Alternatively, the display can be a two-line by 24 character wide LED or vacuum fluorescent display, or one of a number of known, relatively inexpensive and compact displays.\nThe keypad 50 has keys of the type having a tactile feel, with graphic overlay.\nThe keypad 50 has numeric keys 534 which include ten keys for the numbers 0 through 9, and a decimal point key 523. These keys allow entry by the operator of rental, sale and customer identification numbers, quantity, discount information and price changes, and other numerical information.\nThe keyboard has five edit keys which include a Clear All key 502; a Clear Item key 504; a Scroll Up key 508; a Scroll Down key 510; and a Back Space key 524.\nPressing the Clear All key 502 clears all items or entries in the current transaction, and returns the display 148 to a ready state. Any data which was displayed on the display 148 is not forwarded to the master computer 25.\nThe Clear Item key 504 clears the customer identification, item identification and/or the price of the item currently being displayed. This allows a revised customer identification, item identification and/or price of the current item to be entered and displayed.\nThe Scroll Up and Scroll Down keys 508 and 510 change the lines which are displayed. As a result, when a customer has changed his or her mind about a transaction, or when an error has occurred, the operator is able to go back to a line which had been previously entered so that the operator may revise the line as desired. The backspace key 524 moves the operating display cursor (not shown) one space to the left each time this key is depressed. In so doing, the character occupying this space is deleted.\nThe keypad has programmable function keys which include a Tape Return key 506; a No Tax Total key 512; a Print key 514; a Sell key 516; a Quantity key 518; a Discount key 520; a New Price key 522; a Customer key 526; a Rental key 528; a Total key 530; and an Amount Tendered key 532. The functions of these keys will be explained below.\nThe small footprint terminal 23 is surprisingly versatile for a unit so small and inexpensive. It can be used to enter video record transactions and the sales of widely varying merchandise which also might be offered in the same store. It can be used to enter the sales of goods and beverages; clothing; hardware, and many other items as well as the sale, rental or return of video records.\nThis versatility facilitates the installation of video record rental counters or departments in retail food stores, grocery stores, hardware stores, and many other types of stores which often do not rent video records, thus increasing the income of the stores, and expanding the distribution outlets for the video records.\nWhen the terminal is used as a part of a revenue-sharing video record rental it also facilitates the participation of the user in the revenue-sharing plan.\nThe use of the SFT to enter such a wide variety of transactions now will be described.\nWhen power is first applied to the POS system including the SFT, the microcontroller 140 (FIG. 8) provides an operator message or \"prompt\" display via bus 154 to the display 148. The \"prompt\" is shown in Display 1 below. ##STR1##\nDisplay 1 instructs the operator to enter the customer number, or the Item identification number, or the price. If the transaction is a video record rental, the customer number is entered. The item I.D. or price is entered for other transactions.\nAll of this information can be input by use of the keypad 50. The Item identification can be entered by use of the bar-code reader to read the number off of the product, or by use of the keypad. In the situation in which the price is to be entered, as later described, the price will be input by means of the keypad.\nFollowing is an example of the use of the SFT to record a rental transaction in which two video cassettes are rented to one customer.\nIn response to Display 1, the operator enters the customer's identification number, which is 1234567. Then, Display 2 appears, instructing the operator to press the appropriate function key, ##STR2##\nThe proper function key is the Customer key 526 (FIG. 10) which is pressed to indicate that the number is a customer number. Then, the SFT displays the customer's name and any late fees which the customer owes, as shown below in Display 3. In this example, the late fee owed is zero. ##STR3##\nNext, the identification number of the first video cassette of the two to be rented is entered, by means of the keypad or bar-code reader. Upon entering this number, the operator is instructed to press the appropriate function key, as shown below in Display 4. ##STR4##\nSince this video cassette is being rented, rather than sold, the Rental key 528 (FIG. 10) is pressed. As shown below, in Display 5, pressing the Rental key causes the title, rental return date and price of renting that cassette to be retrieved from memory in the master computer and displayed on the SFT display 148. ##STR5##\nNext, information relating to the rental of the second video cassette (\"Title 2\") is entered and displayed using the same steps as those described above for the rental of the first video cassette. These steps are shown by displays 6 and 7 below. ##STR6##\nNext, the Total key 530 is pressed. As shown below, in Display 8, pressing this key causes the total amount, including tax, to be calculated and displayed. Further, individual subtotals of the rental charge; charges for any sales included in the transaction; and tax amounts also are displayed. ##STR7##\nAssume, at this point, that the customer gives the operator $5.00 in payment for the rentals. The operator enters \"5.\", and is instructed to press the appropriate function key, as shown below in Display 9. ##STR8##\nThe operator presses the Amount Tendered key 532, which causes the amount of change owed the customer to be computed and displayed, as shown below in Display 10. ##STR9##\nNext, signals are supplied to the drivers 157 and 158 (FIG. 8) so as to open the cash drawer and activate the buzzer 159. The buzzer warns the operator that the cash drawer is open.\nIf the POS system is configured to automatically print a customer invoice, a data signal containing certain portions of the information relating to the transaction is supplied from the microcontroller 140 via the bus 154 and the parallel I/O circuit 162 to the printer. Upon receipt of this signal, the printer prints a customer invoice. If the POS system is not so configured, an invoice can be printed by pressing the Print key 514.\nIf the transaction is the return of a rented tape cassette, the operator again inputs the customer's identification number in response to Display 1. Alternatively, in this situation, the customer identification number need not be entered.\nNow, the operator presses the Customer key 526, and then the Tape Return key 506. In response, the program of the SFT causes the display of the title of the rental cassette; the due date for its return; and any late fees due for late return of the rental cassette.\nThe Total key 530 and the Amount Tendered key 532 can be used in the manner described above to complete the transaction, and the Print button can be used to print an invoice for the further fees.\nIf a video record is being sold, rather than rented, the operator enters the cassette identification number in response to Display 1, and presses the Sell key 516 this identifies the transaction as a sale rather than a rental. Preferably, the data regarding this transaction, as well as the record rental data is captured, saved and eventually uploaded to the central computer.\nThe sales transaction is concluded in the same manner as the other transactions described above.\nSales of merchandise other than video records can be handled in the same way as for record sales, where the product has an identification code.\nSales of merchandise which has no product code, or sales where the store does not use product codes for merchandise other than records, can be handled in another fashion. When Display 1 appears, the operator simply enters the price of the item together with a decimal point (e.g. \"10.\"), and the program recognizes this as a sale, and the price and the words \"DIRECT SALE\" are displayed.\nThe sales transaction then is completed in the same way as other transactions.\nIn sorting the data concerning video record rentals or sales from other transactions, the identification numbers on the cassettes are used to identify the product as a video record. This causes the data for the transaction to be arranged in a predetermined format. A template is used, in the manner described above, to identify the display, and to data capture selected parts of the data, and to save and upload the data to the central computer.\nVarious other function keys are provided to assist in recording rental and sales transactions.\nThe No Tax Total key 512 is used to calculate a subtotal without including sales tax. Upon depressing this key, \"NO TAX TOTAL\" and the corresponding cost is displayed on the display 148.\nThe Quantity key 518 can be used to enter quantity of the item being sold or rented, where more than one such item is being sold or rented. The resultant cost (i.e., quantity x unit price of the item) is displayed.\nIf the item is being rented, the Quantity key 518 is used to input the number of rental periods, for example, the number of days, for which the customer desires; to keep the record. In this situation, the due date and the price are displayed.\nThe Discount key 520 can be pressed after either an item has been entered, or the Total key 530 has been pressed. In the former situation, the discount entered is applied to the associated item to reduce its price. In the latter situation, the discount entered is applied to the total cost of the transaction.\nIn either situation, the discount value is interpreted by the SFT 23 as an actual discount amount, if the decimal point key 523 is used. However, if the decimal key is not used, then the discount is interpreted as a percentage.\nThe Change Price key 522 is used to override the stored price and manually enter a new price of an item. This allows incorrect or outdated rental or sales prices stored in the data base of the master computer 25 to be corrected. This key may also be used to modify a late fee. However, this key can not be used to change either the total amount of the transaction or the applicable tax.\nAs it is shown in FIG. 10, the keys on the keypad 50 have been arranged optimally. For example, the four most frequently used function keys (that is, the Customer, Rental, Total and Amount keys) are arranged in an array located on the right hand portion of the keypad and in a sequence which is anticipated to be that most often used in a rental transaction.\nThe numeric keys 534 are arranged in a pattern substantially similar to that of most calculator keypads. Further, the more frequently used keys such as the Customer, Tape Return, etc. keys are wider or higher than the other keys and also are identified with distinctive colors.\nThis arrangement makes the keypad 50 very user friendly. As a result, daily operations are relatively easy to perform. Further, training time for new operators is minimized.\nThe SFT achieves its compact size and low cost in part by the elimination of the 26 letter keys of the usual keyboard. It also uses a display of greatly reduced size and cost to achieve those results.\nDespite the lower cost and smaller size, the terminal is versatile and reliable. More over it is not \"dumb\"; it has its own \"intelligence\" and storage capacity, and programming which helps it achieve versatility.\nReferring again to FIG. 8, the keypad controller 150 preferably is a microprocessor, such as the model number 16C54 microprocessor manufactured by the MicroChip Corporation. The chip 150 contains a ROM. Stored in this ROM is a program used for controlling the keypad operation. The keypad controller is adapted to \"debounce\" the keypad in a conventional manner, and to transmit data corresponding to the operator-selected keys to the microcontroller 140.\nCircuits 156, 157 and 162 provide tke respective interfaces for the bar code wand 18, the cash drawer 17 and the printer 16.\nThe programmable serial I/O circuit 156 contains a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART) integrated circuit device and is adapted to provide a serial interface for the bar code wand. As a result, data received from the bar code wand is supplied to the microcontroller 140.\nThe driver circuit 157, in response to a predetermined signal from the microcontroller 140, supplies an enabling signal to the cash drawer 15 which causes the cash drawer to open. An additional predetermined signal is supplied from the microcontroller 140 through a driver circuit 158 to a buzzer 159. The buzzer 159 is activated to inform the operator of the opening of the cash drawer.\nThe parallel I/O circuit 162 is adapted to enable data transfer between the SFT 23 and the printer 16. Circuit 162 includes a parallel port which may function in a bi-directional manner, that is, as either an input or an output port.\nThe buzzer 159 is also actuated if one of the previously-described error messages is displayed, or when a function is completed which has taken longer than a predetermined time, for example, a few seconds, to complete. In this latter situation, the use of the buzzer helps to reduce operator fatigue, by allowing the operator to direct his or her attention away from the SFT 23 during relatively long processing time periods.\nThe buzzer also is activated if a key is pressed out of the correct sequence. In this situation, the display 148 will display an \"INVALID KEY\" message for a predetermined time period which, for example, may be approximately one second.\nThe data, address and control bus 154 is connected to the circuits of the SFT 23 as shown in FIG. 8. This bus provides a controlled path by which data may be transferred between the circuits of the SFT.\nThe unique serial number circuit 160, LAN I/O circuit 164 and the power supply circuit 166 are substantially similar to the unique serial number circuit 114, LAN I/O circuit 120 and power supply circuit 122, previously explained with reference to FIG. 7 and, as such, will not be further described.\nUpon applying power to the SFT 23 through the power supply circuit 166, the boot-up program stored in the EPROM 144 is executed by the microcontroller 140. This causes an operating program from the master computer 42 to be downloaded into the RAM 146. Thereafter, the microcontroller 140 executes the operating program stored in the RAM 146.\nAs with the EPROM 106 of FIG. 7, the EPROM 144 may contain predetermined subroutines which may be referenced in the operating program. When this occurs, such subroutines will be read from the EPROM 144 and executed during the execution of the operating program by the microcontroller 140.\nThe SFT 23 is enabled to receive incoming data from the master computer 25 via the LAN I/O circuit 164. The SFT may also receive incoming data from the bar code reader 18 or the credit card reader 28 via the programmable serial I/O circuit 156.\nThe SFT also receives operator-input data from the keypad 50. The SFT, through use of the microcontroller 140, provides data to the printer 16 and the display 148, and provides enabling signals to the cash drawer 15. The SFT also supplies data relating to completed transactions via the LAN I/O circuit 164 to the master computer 25.\nCable connectors (not shown) are provided at the rear of the SFT 23 for cable connections to each of the bar code wand; the credit card reader; the printer; the cash drawer; and the LAN.\nThe small footprint terminal provides a relatively simple, compact and inexpensive sales terminal for POS systems in general, and particularly for video record rental and sales activity. By recognizing that the full keyboard, video screen and other features of a full-feature input computer are not necessary, applicants have lowered the cost and space requirement for entry into the efficient computerized business operations, and revenue-sharing video record rentals.\nFIG. 9 is a block diagram of the LAN adapter 27. The LAN adapter enables data communications between the master computer and all units which are connected to the LAN adapter, including, for example, SFT's and data taps. The LAN adapter circuitry preferably is configured to be mounted on a single printed circuit board which may be inserted into an expansion slot of the master computer. Upon being inserted into the expansion slot, the LAN adapter card is connected to the master computer's bus. This enables power to be supplied to the LAN adapter and enables data transfer.\nThe LAN adapter includes a microprocessor 180, a memory segmentation and selection circuit 182, a programmable serial I/O circuit 188, a LAN I/O circuit 190, a dual port arbitration circuit 192 and a dual port RAM 196.\nThe microprocessor, I/O circuits, and memory circuits preferably are the same as corresponding components in the data tap and SFT, to obtain the benefits of standardization.\nThe memory segmentation and selection circuit 182 includes an EPROM 184 having 32 k-bytes of memory capacity and a RAM 186 having 64 k-bytes of memory capacity. The circuit 182 is adapted to function in a manner similar to that of the previously described memory segmentation and selection circuits 104 and 142. That is, the EPROM 184 is adapted to store a boot code program. This stored boot program is executed by the microprocessor 180 when power is applied to the LAN adapter or when the microprocessor is reset.\nAs a result of executing this program, a main operating program is downloaded from the master computer into the RAM. The main program is then executed by the microprocessor. This program enables the LAN adapter to perform a rapidly repeating polling of the units connected to the LAN adapter. The results of this polling are supplied to the master computer, and the master computer responds accordingly. For example, as previously described, data taps are periodically polled to determine if they have data for the master computer. If they do, then the master computer may request such data be transmitted to the master computer by way of the LAN adapter.\nThe dual port RAM 196, which in a preferred embodiment is an 8 k-byte dual port RAM, enables the LAN adapter to communicated with the master computer in an asynchronous manner. Utilizing such a dual port RAM increases the amount of data transfer between the adapter and the master computer by eliminating the need for hardware interrupts. However, only one of the LAN adapter and the master computer may access the dual port RAM at a given time. Controlling which of these devices has access to the dual port RAM is performed by the dual port arbitration circuit 192.\nThe dual port arbitration circuit 132 generates a control signal which indicates when the dual port RAM is activated. This control signal is supplied from the dual port arbitration circuit to the master computer. In response to this control signal, neither the LAN adapter nor the master computer will attempt to access the dual port RAM while the dual port RAM is in use. That is, whichever first accesses the dual port RAM asserts an arbitration/bit flag so as to deny the other access until the bit is reset.\nThe dual port arbitration circuit all. so sets the address range of the dual port RAM. Since in the preferred embodiment the dual port RAM contains 8 k-bytes of memory capacity, the dual port RAM only requires an 8-k address range. However, the master computer is typically adapted to address a memory from within a 24-bit address range and the LAN adapter is adapted to address a memory from within a 16-bit address range. To accommodate this difference in address ranges, an 8-bit memory offset address switch 194 is utilized. That is, this offset address switch shifts the 8-k address range of the dual port RAM within the 24 bit address range of the master computer as required.\nThe LAN I/O circuit 190 is adapted to transmit and receive data to and from the devices connected to the LAN adapter such as a data tap and a SFT. Communications between these devices and the LAN I/O circuit are differentially driven by using, for example, RS-422 and RS-485 interfaces. This LAN I/O circuit operates substantially similar to the previously described LAN I/O circuits 120 and 164 and, as such, will not be further described.\nThe programmable serial I/O circuit 188 is adapted to transform data between serial and parallel format. In a preferred embodiment, the programmable serial I/O circuit contains a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART).\nA LED 191 is coupled to the LAN I/O circuit 190 and is adapted to provide an indication of the current operating status of the LAN adapter. For example, a lit LED indicates that the LAN adapter is being addressed.\nAs shown in FIG. 9, the data, address and control bus 198 enables controlled communications between the microprocessor 180, memory segmentation and selection circuit 182, programmable serial I/O circuit 188 and the dual port arbitration circuit 192. Communication between the programmable serial I/O circuit 188 and the LAN I/O circuit 190 is by way of a bus 199. Likewise, communication between the dual port arbitration circuit 192 and the dual port RAM 196 is by way of a communication bus 197.\nThus, the LAN adapter performs polling of the attached slave units and processes commands received from the master computer for transmission to the respective slave units.\nBy performing the polling function in the LAN adapter, instead of the master computer, the demand on processing cycles is reduced in the master computer. As a result, a master computer having slower processing speed may be utilized, thus reducing the costs. Alternatively, the master computer may use the processing cycles saved in performing additional functions.\nBy utilizing the RS-422 or RS-485 interfaces, data communication over a relatively long path can be accommodated.\nIf only one POS station in a store is needed, without SFT's or data taps, the LAN adapter is not required. However, if additional check-out stations are added and one or more SFTs or data taps is added, the LAN adapter can be installed easily in an expansion slot of the master computer.\nIn some personal computer operating environments, such as those supporting a graphical user's interface (GUI), for example, WINDOWS\u00ae from the Microsoft Corp. and OS/2\u00ae from the Microsoft or the IBM corporations, screen displays may be controlled on a bit-by-bit basis. In these circumstances, the TEACHER and TRAPPER programs may be modified so as to be used therein. These modified versions may be responsive to ASCII or other standard coding methods. However, the ASCII representations are not typically written directly to the display controller, but would be otherwise communicated within the operating environment in a way that is easily accessible by the TEACHER or TRAPPER.\nAlthough preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail herein, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that many modifications and variations may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following claims.", "id": "<urn:uuid:2aa7e7c1-ac58-4f59-8da0-a134a36356c8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2015-14", "url": "http://www.google.com.au/patents/US5396417", "date": "2015-03-30T17:34:53Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-14/segments/1427131299515.96/warc/CC-MAIN-20150323172139-00064-ip-10-168-14-71.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9265978336334229, "token_count": 23995}, "content": [{"line": "US 5396417 A", "label": "patent number", "split": false}, {"line": "A data collection device and method, particularly for point-of-sale systems used in the sales and rental of merchandise including video records, and more particularly for a revenue-sharing video record rental system.

Therefore, the video record business forms only a portion of the business of many rental stores. This is particularly true where the store is one which primarily sells other merchandise, such as supermarkets, department stores, etc. Therefore, there is a substantial amount of data which must be sorted out from the record rental information. This sorting should be done in the stores before the transmission of data to the central computer to prevent overloading the central computer equipment, thus increasing its cost, and also increasing the cost of data transmission and processing.

{"doc": {"text": "Chevrolet has taken the wrapping off its newest iteration of the Camaro. Engulfed in a holy war between the Mustang, the Camaro has always been a bit of an underdog. The original Mustang wiped the floor with the original Camaro, in terms of sales, and has kept going up until 2010 where the Camaro has outsold the Mustang since. The last Camaro was a good looking car, though the design got a bit frumpy as time went on, and in most trim levels was very fast.\nBut, aside from the Z/28, it always seem to lack in the handling and interior departments, compared to its competitors.\nHowever, Chevy seems to be hellbent on rectifying those issues with the new 2016 Camaro. The biggest changes come from under the hood, where the Camaro now offers three engine choices. A 2.0 liter turbocharged four-cylinder is now standard in the base car, while a naturally aspirated V6 is optional as well as a fire-breathing 6.2 liter LT1 V8, sourced from the Corvette, in SS guise. The four-banger will boast 272 horses while the V6 will make 335 horsepower and the V8 will have 455 stampeding horses. All engine choices will be available with 6-Speed manuals and 8-Speed automatics.\nFor 2016, the Camaro has also dropped some weight, around 200 lbs worth. That\u2019s a significant amount, and much needed, considering the previous Camaro was a bit of a porker. The New Camaro is also built upon GM\u2019s latest Alpha architecture, which also underpins the Cadillac ATS and CTS, so it should be a rigid chassis with good dynamics. Another benefit of the new chassis is size. The 2016 Camaro will be 2.3 inches shorter in length, 0.8 inches narrower and 1.1 inches shorter in height. This should give the Camaro a bit more nimble feeling over the outgoing car, as that one felt a bit barge-like.\nBoth exterior and interior have been revised as well. The exterior is a bit of the same, which just a nip/tuck here and there to give it a cleaner, tighter look. The last car looked pretty good, so why fix what ain\u2019t broke, right? But it\u2019s the interior that has gone through the biggest change. With a flat-bottomed steering wheel, much nicer ergonomics and a fancy LCD screen in the gauge cluster, the new Camaro\u2019s interior is miles ahead of the outgoing car. The last-gen\u2019s interior felt like it was built by Fisher Price, but Chevy claims this new one has far better materials.\nAccording to some track drives, the new V6 is responsive with a throaty engine note and the shifter is quick and crisp with a light clutch pedal. It\u2019s also said to have direct steering and a balanced and firm chassis. No word on performance numbers just yet, but expect the Camaro to be very competitive with the new Mustang in comparable trim levels.\nWe won\u2019t know for sure, exactly how the Camaro feels, until we get behind the wheel, but with the success of the ATS and CTS I have a feeling that GM is learning how to make some nice handling cars. So I\u2019m assuming that this new Camaro will be no different.", "id": "<urn:uuid:2d91d002-2d89-4433-853b-09f7b87a0863>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2017-34", "url": "http://www.bmwblog.com/2015/05/18/new-2016-chevrolet-camaro-with-455-hp/", "date": "2017-08-19T18:50:01Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2017-34/segments/1502886105712.28/warc/CC-MAIN-20170819182059-20170819202059-00200.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9576672911643982, "token_count": 706}, "content": [{"line": "Chevrolet has taken the wrapping off its newest iteration of the Camaro.

The waiter instantly offers to replace the dish, since The Cheesecake Factory is committed to \"absolute guest satisfaction,\" according to Donald Moore, chief culinary officer for The Cheesecake Factory Inc.\nSo the diner opts for the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich (crispy coated chicken breast covered with melted cheese and either spicy Buffalo or chipotle mayo, served on a brioche bun), and subsequently reaches the company's desired level of satisfaction.\nThat very same day, diners at Cheesecake Factory outposts in Wauwatosa, Wis., Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., and Pembroke Pines, Fla., also complain about the texture of the pickles on their burgers.\nAre these hypothetical experiences related in any way?

{"doc": {"text": "LISBON, Mar 22 (IPS) - The huge impact of the economic crisis on male employment in Portugal has led to a sharp increase in the proportion of women who have become the main breadwinners in their families. But that has not translated into progress towards equality.\n\"Today there is more male unemployment than female, because the crisis has especially affected the civil construction industry,\" said An\u00e1lia Torres, a professor at the Technical University of Lisbon's Higher Institute of Social and Political Sciences.\n\"With less economic activity in that industry, which traditionally employs men, the male unemployment rate has climbed, while in sectors that generally employ women, unemployment grew much less,\" Torres said in an interview with IPS.\nThe European Commission expects unemployment in Portugal to reach 17.3 percent in 2013. But opposition parties and trade unions project a rate of 24 percent.\nProfessor An\u00e1lia Torres at the Technical University of Lisbon's Higher Institute of Social and Political Sciences. Credit: Mario Queiroz/IPS\nThe gap between the figures is explained by the thousands of people who have stopped registering at the government employment centres or have moved abroad, mainly to other European countries or to the former Portuguese colonies of Brazil, Angola, Mozambique or Macau.\nAmong those who only have a primary school education, \"the woman always earns less than the man,\" Torres said. \"And as the educational level increases, the difference between the incomes of men and women grows. A woman with a doctorate earns much less than a man (with the same degree).\"\nIn areas like education and health, where women earn 20 percent less than men, it is men who are most often laid off \"because they are more expensive.\"\nAnother factor that puts women in the position of bringing home the bacon \"is that many remunerated activities carried out by women are in the informal economy, undeclared or unskilled work, such as cleaning or babysitting in the homes of the well-off,\" the academic said.\nIn Portugal, the 1961-1974 colonial war in the country's overseas territories in Africa \u2013 Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique \u2013 \"led to large numbers of women replacing men (in the workplace),\" Torres said.\nSince then, \"the idea of the working woman who helps support her family has remained in place,\" she added.\nDuring the war, Portugal maintained a permanent force of 220,000 military troops \u2013 an enormous figure compared to a population at the time of 8.8 million (10.6 million today).\nIn the 1960s, one million people from Portugal moved abroad for economic reasons or to avoid being sent to war in Africa. Women, Torres said, \"took on a central role in a country with very few men of working age.\"\nNevertheless, \"the predominant sexism persisted, and men continue to make a show of unacceptable machismo today,\" she said.\n\"By refusing to help do things around the home on the argument that \u2018I am a man, I don't do that kind of work', which also causes serious domestic violence problems, men show that the sexist culture is still in place.\"\nWomen are sometimes the target of violence, often with tragic results, because many men \"base their masculinity on their wage-earning power, even though both men and women have been working and supporting the family for a long time now in Portugal,\" Torres added.\nBetween January and November 2012, 30 women were killed in Portugal by their partners or ex-partners, according to UMAR, one of the largest women's organisations in the country.\nThat makes Portugal the country with the largest number of femicides \u2013 gender-related murders \u2013 in the European Union, in proportion to the population.\nBut \"working is also a kind of insurance against machismo, in the sense of women being aware that they are making a living and don't need men,\" Torres said.\nSociologist and researcher Sofia Aboim of the University of Lisbon's Institute of Social Sciences said that in the last eight years, the proportion of couples in which the woman is the main breadwinner has risen from two to 16.5 percent.\nIt is \"obvious\" that many men \"have suffered a strong blow to their self-esteem, because their masculinity is traditionally associated closely with supporting the family,\" she wrote in the newspaper P\u00fablico about the conclusions of a study on the subject.\nAboim said this situation was seen especially in couples with low levels of education and in older couples, especially between the ages of 51 and 65.\nBut Torres said discrimination against women is also deeply rooted among more educated segments of the population, even though \"there are many women with excellent educations - teachers and professors, for instance.\"\nIn general, \"the highest-level posts are filled by men, even though, for example in the academic world, studies show that there is no difference in the production of research or articles. But women are not heads of institutes and are not on the boards of universities, with very few exceptions,\" she said.\nOne big exception is the Centre for Judicial Studies, which provides training for future judges and prosecutors. Because the centre accepts lawyers on the basis of competitive examinations, \"80 percent of those who have been accepted for training as magistrates in the last decade were women, because they scored higher than men.\"\nThe problems plaguing Portugal affect everyone, \"but in the crisis, women face greater difficulties, aggravated in cases in which their husbands are unemployed, because they still have to take everything on their shoulders.\n\"The worst thing about this government (of conservative Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho) is its complete insensitivity and indifference towards the plight of the people,\" Torres said.\nThis is especially serious in Portugal and other countries where sexism is predominant, she said, because \"if a woman has work and her partner does not, she continues to do the housework, unlike what occurs in other places, where men participate in the housework when they are unemployed.\"\n\u00a9 Inter Press Service (2013) \u2014 All Rights ReservedOriginal source: Inter Press Service\nLatest News Headlines\nRead the latest news stories:\n- U.S. Strategy on Water, Development a \u201cMajor Advance\u201d Wednesday, May 22, 2013\n- Stressed Ecosystems Leaving Humanity High and Dry Tuesday, May 21, 2013\n- Organic Cooperative Proves that Agriculture Can Prosper in Cuba Tuesday, May 21, 2013\n- Indigenous Brazilians Learn to Fight for the Right to Food Tuesday, May 21, 2013\n- Seeking Justice for Dictatorship Victims \u2013 Two Continents Apart Tuesday, May 21, 2013\n- Tackling Crime Takes on Import As Urban Populations Rise Tuesday, May 21, 2013\n- Q&A: Guantanamo 'Has No Right to Exist' Tuesday, May 21, 2013\n- UNFPA Focuses on Contraception for 222 Million in Developing World Tuesday, May 21, 2013\n- Caribbean Farming Gets Its Roots Wet Tuesday, May 21, 2013\n- Zimbabwe\u2019s Ruling Party Militias Spread Fear of Voting Tuesday, May 21, 2013", "id": "<urn:uuid:e46b7456-a101-498d-9ec0-20465d5c0352>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.globalissues.org/news/2013/03/22/16153", "date": "2013-05-22T07:12:50Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368701459211/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516105059-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9681819677352905, "token_count": 1466}, "content": [{"line": "LISBON, Mar 22 (IPS) - The huge impact of the economic crisis on male employment in Portugal has led to a sharp increase in the proportion of women who have become the main breadwinners in their families.

{"doc": {"text": "Last of three parts\nMost people think that if you drink and drive, and you wear the blue, you\u2019ll lose your job and your career if you\u2019re caught.\nThe truth is more complex: Dallas takes a hard line, firing officers convicted of drunken driving. Other departments, such as Houston and Austin, offer last-chance mechanisms for first-time offenders to stay on the force.\nIn addition, the state\u2019s licensing board for law enforcement has a hearing process that over the last six years has allowed at least 30 officers who committed misdemeanor offenses, including alcohol-related crimes, to retain their peace officer licenses and continue working.\nBut recent changes at the state level are likely to make it much more difficult for officers to keep their jobs when they are caught drinking and driving, or committing other misdemeanors.\nIn December, the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Education, or TCLEOSE, revised its policy so that no officer can get full probation of a license suspension for a misdemeanor. Instead, such officers must lose their licenses for some period.\nLoss of a peace officer\u2019s license for any period may mean an officer\u2019s career ends. Departments find it difficult to leave a job open for someone who can\u2019t carry a gun and a badge.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to ensure that officers are held accountable for their actions and to live up to the responsibilities of our mission statement, where we ensure that the public is served by ethical and well-trained officers,\u201d said Kim Vickers, the commission\u2019s executive director.\nA second chance\nThe city of Austin gives some officers accused of drunken driving a second chance if the incident didn\u2019t involve an injury or serious property damage. Typically, the department suspends officers for 30 to 45 days.\nThe department requires those officers to undergo an evaluation, get counseling and treatment and participate in a peer support program.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always tried to have a humanistic view, especially if nobody\u2019s been hurt,\u201d said Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo. \u201cWe invest a lot of time and money in our employees. \u2026 We can try to save them. But they\u2019re not going to get a second bite at the apple.\u201d\nHouston also offers officers a second chance, so long as certain criteria are met and the officers accept counseling.\n\u201cThe idea is at least for that offense \u2026 to try to figure out a way to get the officer some help,\u201d said Executive Assistant Chief Michael Dirden, who oversees the department\u2019s internal affairs division.\nDirden said the state has tried to \u201cenforce our way\u201d out of the drinking and driving problem, \u201cand it just hasn\u2019t helped.\u201d\nBut TCLEOSE ultimately holds the power to decide whether a person remains a sworn peace officer.\nFaron Graeter defused bombs for a living for the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Department. After a 2005 drunken-driving arrest and subsequent conviction, he was fired.\nTCLEOSE could have suspended his license for 10 years. But through a little-used hearing process, Graeter kept his right to stay in law enforcement. He won his civil service appeal and could have gone back to work in Harris County but is now a full-time firefighter and reserve officer for a small southeast Texas community.\n\u201cEverybody makes mistakes,\u201d said Graeter. \u201cA regular person isn\u2019t automatically fired from their job. There has to be a middle ground.\u201d\nOfficers convicted of felonies automatically lose their peace officer licenses. But for Class A and B misdemeanors, including most DWIs, officers can go through the hearing process in an attempt to save their careers.\nMany simply surrender their licenses or allow them to lapse. A small number fight.\nOut of 70 cases since 2006 in which a hearing was sought through the State Office of Administrative Hearings, about 30 officers received full probation of their suspensions, meaning they never had a day when they couldn\u2019t legally work as a peace officer.\nAdministrative law judges conduct hearings and then make recommendations. Recently, TCLEOSE has become much more likely to bypass those recommendations and mete out harsher sanctions.\nSince 2006, about 15 officers convicted of DWI have succeeded in getting full probation of their suspensions. About five officers prosecuted for reckless driving or obstructing a passageway \u2014 typically alcohol-related offenses \u2014 received full probation of their suspensions.\nA few others convicted of DWI received \u201chard suspensions,\u201d in which they lost their licenses for short periods, then were placed on probation for the remainder of their suspensions. Once on probation, an officer could return to work.\nOccasionally, officers have been able to bypass the hearing process and receive probation of suspensions after reaching an agreement with the commission\u2019s executive director. None of those were for DWI convictions. Those agreements still must be approved by the state commission.\nNone of the officers who received probation of their suspensions \u2014 for alcohol or other offenses \u2014 have reoffended, commission officials said.\nDallas\u2019 hard line\nOut of about 30 suspensions for which the commission granted full probation, more than half were for officers from Harris and surrounding counties.\n\u201cThese usually are good officers who are out there doing a good day\u2019s work, putting people in jail and solving crimes,\u201d said Robert Armbruster, a Houston Police Officers\u2019 Union attorney who frequently represents Houston-area officers in hearings before the commission.\nHouston officers also represented about 40 percent of those who received full probation of suspensions on DWI convictions.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a lawyer, you don\u2019t lose your license if you get a DWI,\u201d Armbruster said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a judge, you don\u2019t lose your ability to be on the bench if you get a DWI. How about doctors, the people cutting you open? Those people don\u2019t lose their license if they have a DWI.\u201d\nOnly a few North Texas officers received full probation of suspensions for any type of offense through the hearing process. Not one was a Dallas police officer, though one from the Dallas department got by with a reprimand on his license for an alcohol-related offense.\nDallas takes a hard line. At least 21 Dallas officers have been fired since 2006 over alcohol-related incidents. About six others resigned.\n\u201cThe public expects us to be above reproach,\u201d said Dallas Assistant Chief Floyd Simpson, who oversees the department\u2019s administrative bureau. \u201cHow can you go out and enforce DWI laws when you got caught and convicted of basically the same thing?\u201d\nBut Glenn White, president of Dallas\u2019 largest police association for almost two decades until he recently stepped aside, believes the city is losing good officers.\n\u201cThey need to come up with an alternative punishment,\u201d White said. \u201cThey never capitalize on the people that realize they made a mistake.\u201d\nThe TCLEOSE policy revisions that just took effect don\u2019t alter much for departments that typically have zero tolerance policies. But the changes might make the state license hearing process less advantageous for officers working in departments with a more forgiving outlook.\nIn the past, when an officer received deferred adjudication probation for a Class A or B misdemeanor, his or her license could be suspended only for the period the officer was on probation. The new rules require that deferred adjudication probation be treated the same as a conviction, potentially forcing many more officers into the hearing process if they want to save their careers.\nAdministrative law judges also will no longer be able to recommend full probation of a license suspension. For Class B misdemeanors, which include most alcohol-related offenses, officers must lose their licenses for at least 30 days. They are to lose their licenses for at least 120 days for Class A misdemeanors.\nCommission officials believe that the trend will be for the commission to frequently impose tougher sanctions than the judges recommend.\nDepartments won\u2019t be required to fire officers during the time a license is suspended, but they must remove them as sworn peace officers.\nAustin\u2019s Acevedo said he probably would have to fire officers in such cases because he wouldn\u2019t have the luxury of squirreling them away somewhere for months at a time.\n\u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have positions we can put them in,\u201d said Acevedo, adding that his department would have to review the implications of the new rules. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance they will get fired and have to reapply for reinstatement.\u201d\nHouston officials said the new rules have no bearing on how they will proceed.\n\u201cThe chief of police will make an independent decision and issue appropriate discipline based on the facts of each case,\u201d Dirden said in an email. \u201cAny requirements or penalties imposed by the state will be separate and distinct from action taken by the department.\u201d\nBY THE NUMBERS\nAlcohol-related arrests and peace-officer license suspensions and revocations in Texas, 2006-11:\n439: DWI arrests of peace officers reported to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Education.\n111: Officers whose peace officer licenses were suspended after they were convicted of DWI. Most did not appeal and were suspended for a mandatory 10-year period.\n25: Officers whose licenses were suspended after they were convicted or received deferred adjudication probation for obstructing a roadway or reckless driving, often alcohol-related offenses.\n7: Officers whose licenses were revoked after they were convicted of felony alcohol-related offenses, such as intoxication assault and intoxication manslaughter.\nNOTE: Of the 439 officers arrested for DWI, some simply let their licenses lapse.

A further roll-out across other stores will then be considered.\nIt involves the retailers\u2019 in-store assistants helping customers with two defined shopping journeys (from a total of seven that have been developed by Dressipi) via the iPad. The sales assistant simply scans barcodes on items, which then link to the customers\u2019 Fashion Fingerprint and the app recommends items and outfits based on the merchant\u2019s products.\nFuture developments on the app will involve proposing the top 10 items in-store for that particular customer. And once fully tested the app will be usable unassisted in-store.\nThe value of the recommendations is based on the thorough \u201cconcrete\u201d data Dressipi accumulates on each shopper through its Fashion Footprint. McVittie says this consists of attitude and sizing data on the customer along with their lifestyle preferences.\nWorking with its retail clients Dressipi then compliments this information with 50 points of data on the each individual garment and adds in the customers\u2019 purchase history as well as any feedback they have given on goods bought.\nThis rich data is able to drive great insights that she says deliver undisputable double-digit revenue increases and uplifts in average basket values for retailers.

{"doc": {"text": "- Sticky, Gooey, Creamy, Chewy - http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com -\nEaster Brunch SGCC-Style\nPosted By Susan On April 1, 2012 @ 4:31 pm In Holidays,Recipes,SGCC Rewinds | 13 Comments\nOf the great triumvirate of Christian holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter), Easter is my favorite. While I love eating myself into oblivion at Thanksgiving, and Christmas (the gifts are nice too), I actually enjoy the fact that Easter isn\u2019t as food-centric. I find it to be a much more relaxing and low-key holiday than the others, which in turn means less stress for me. And, I\u2019m all about less stress these days! While, it would be unthinkable in my family to have Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner in a restaurant (gasp!), the same does not apply to Easter. Unless we\u2019re invited to someone\u2019s home, we almost always enjoy our Easter meal at one of our favorite restaurants.\nOn the other hand, if your family is anything like mine, they will be clamoring for food long before the time a 4:00 dinner reservation rolls around. To stave off the hungry horde, I always prepare a few dishes ahead of time that can either be warmed up in the oven or simply served cold that morning. Here are some great \u201cstress-less\u201d brunch ideas from the SGCC archives for a lovely, laid back, Easter Sunday brunch.\nFresh, ripe strawberries are blended with yogurt, sour cream, lime juice and honey to make this rich and lush chilled soup. It\u2019s like a cross between a mousse and a smoothie. Frozen berries can also be used in a pinch. Whip it up a day or two in advance, although it may not last that long.\nChicks in a Nest \nChicks in a Nest is a great dish to serve for a brunch buffet. Each serving is completely self-contained and can just be picked up and popped on a plate. The \u201cnests\u201d are made from shredded potatoes that are baked in a muffin tin, which are then served filled with scrambled or poached eggs. You can shred your own potatoes or use a bag of the pre-shredded kind, like I did. The potato nests can be made a day ahead and crisped up in the oven before serving.\nA strata is casserole made with bread, eggs and whatever cheese, meats or vegetables you feel like putting into it. Think of it as a savory bread pudding. This one is filled with onions, ham, mozzarella and Swiss cheese. The best thing about a strata is that it\u2019s meant to be made in advance. In fact, it really must be put together and allowed to sit for several hours or overnight before baking. For your trouble, you\u2019re rewarded with a puffy and golden mass of cheesy, meaty, eggy goodness.\nA kugel is actually a Jewish dish, commonly served on holidays and special occasions. It\u2019s a baked casserole, sweet or savory, that is usually made with egg noodles or potatoes, and often with cottage or cream cheese. In this savory version, I\u2019ve blended cottage cheese, sour cream and a velvety chevre with noodles and assorted vegetables for a sumptuous dish with a subtle tang. A dusting of panko crumbs on top gives it a little crunch and extra texture. This kugel is best baked up a day ahead and served at room temperature.\nThis light and luscious chicken salad is chock full of fresh and dried fruits and nuts bathed in a creamy dressing punctuated with fresh herbs. You can use any combination and quantity of fruits, nuts and herbs that you like, and it always turns out great. Served in big, juicy, hollowed out tomatoes, pineapple boats or avocado halves, this Tutti Frutti Chicken Salad really sings Springtime!\nThis lovely little salad features crisp tender green beans, potatoes, sweet grape tomatoes and thin slivers of red onion. I pair it with a zesty vinaigrette, accented with Dijon mustard, lemon, garlic, honey and fresh herbs. Serve it either warm or chilled and topped with some chopped hard boiled egg for extra richness. It makes a lovely complement to any meal.\nThis pasta salad is quick and ridiculously easy to put together. And, it\u2019s full of zesty, bold flavors. The dressing is simply a mixture of mayonnaise, lemon juice and store bought pesto sauce \u2013 the kind you find in the refrigerator section at the supermarket. You can serve it as is, or punch it up by mixing in some poached chicken, tuna or tasty little salad shrimp. Any way you serve this Presto Pesto Pasta Salad, your guests will be dishing out the complements!\nPizza Rustica \nOf course, no Easter Sunday brunch at Chez SGCC would be complete without a few traditional Italian Easter pies, like this Pizza Rustica. It\u2019s a big, cheesy, meaty, creamy hunk of a pie stuffed to the gills with six different kinds of cured and fresh meat. Yes, I said SIX! One slice is pretty much a complete meal in itself. A Pizza Rustica does take some time to put together, but trust me, it is worth the effort. Plus, it can be made a few days in advance and is best served at room temperature.\nTorta di Riso \nTorta di Riso is a rich and creamy egg and ricotta based dessert pie filled filled with cooked Arborio rice and delicately flavored with the essence of orange. Think of it as rice pudding in a crust. This pie is usually made using a traditional rolled pie crust. But, I\u2019ve made it a little easier to make and more interesting to eat by using layers of paper thin phyllo dough to envelope my filling. The phyllo gives this torta a delightfully crispy, buttery crust that shatters beneath your teeth as you bite into it. It\u2019s simply amazing!\nAnd, we certainly can\u2019t forget dessert, especially when it\u2019s a luxuriously rich and creamy cheesecake like this one! My version of this Italian classic is made with both ricotta and mascarpone cheeses, giving it a super silky smooth texture. I flavor it with the heady combination or pure vanilla and a splash of orange flower water, that is sure to make both you and your guests swoon.\nButtery Lemon Bars \nLemon Bars are a quintessential Springtime treat. This version boasts a rich and buttery shortbread crust topped with an ultra-lemony curd that is the perfect balance of sweet and tart. These are honestly the best lemon bars I\u2019ve ever eaten \u2013 bar none!\nArticle printed from Sticky, Gooey, Creamy, Chewy: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com\nURL to article: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2012/04/01/easter-brunch-sgcc-style/\nURLs in this post:\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/easter-brunch.jpg\n Sumptuous Strawberry Soup: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2008/06/18/summertime-an-the-livin-is-easy/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/strawberry-soup.jpg\n Chicks in a Nest: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2009/07/31/breakfast-at-tiffanys-roundup-chicks-in-a-nest/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ChicksinaNest1.jpg\n Anytime Ham, Cheese and Egg Strata: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2011/08/10/anytime-egg-ham-and-cheese-strata-recipe/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Egg-Strata-2.jpg\n Vegetable Noodle Kugel: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2009/01/29/savory-vegetable-noodle-kugel-for-rfj/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/kugel-23.jpg\n Tutti Frutti Chicken Salad: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2009/08/25/tutti-frutti-chicken-salad/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/chicken-salad-1.jpg\n Green Bean and Potato Salad with Dijon Vinaigrette: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2011/07/28/green-bean-and-potato-salad-with-dijon-vinaigrette-recipe/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/green-bean-dijonnaise-2.jpg\n Presto Pesto Pasta Salad: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2011/06/28/presto-pesto-pasta-salad-recipe/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/pesto-pasta-salad-4.jpg\n Pizza Rustica: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2008/03/15/baking-with-mom-part-1-pizza-rustica/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/pizza-rustica.jpg\n Torta di Riso: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2010/03/24/sgcc-encore-torta-di-riso-for-easter/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/torta-di-riso.jpg\n Italian Ricotta Cheesecake: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2011/02/20/la-tavola-della-mia-famiglia-italian-ricotta-cheesecake-recipe/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ricotta-cheesecake-1.jpg\n Buttery Lemon Bars: http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2011/03/20/buttery-lemon-bars-a-recipe-in-pictures-or-what-was-i-thinking/\n : http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lemon-bars-1.jpg\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 StickyGooeyCreamyChewy.com.", "id": "<urn:uuid:41677772-38a3-4c75-bc5f-6ac1ebf9406a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2012/04/01/easter-brunch-sgcc-style/print/", "date": "2013-05-22T21:24:04Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368702448584/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516110728-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.8760274648666382, "token_count": 2502}, "content": [{"line": "- Sticky, Gooey, Creamy, Chewy - http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com -", "label": "url without context", "split": false}, {"line": "Easter Brunch SGCC-Style", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Posted By Susan On April 1, 2012 @ 4:31 pm In Holidays,Recipes,SGCC Rewinds | 13 Comments", "label": "date without context", "split": false}, {"line": "Of the great triumvirate of Christian holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter), Easter is my favorite.

{"doc": {"text": "ELITE GOALKEEPING KIT SIZING HAS CHANGED.\nWhen we launched the kit in 2019 it was designed for bigger \u2018keepers. But, the protection and rebound characteristics mean that demand for a smaller size has developed that we want to satisfy. So, in 2019 the largest size was classified as large and the next size down was a medium. BUT those sizes were equivalent to XL and L in the Pro range.\nFor 2020 we will be running X-Large, Large and Medium. The 2020 X-Large is the same as the 2019 Large size and the 2020 Large size is the same as the 2019 Medium. We have then introduced a new size \u2013 actual Medium.

This process removes any glue that can harden and shatter over time, this reducing the foam de-lamination that can be seen in other pads. The outer layer of foam has a skin or crust, reducing the friction that occurs between pad and pitch, aiding sliding and smothering. The internal shape has been modified to fit a longer leg with the two straps positioned to fit around the calf and below the knee. The legguards have been shaped to give the maximum legal (under FIH regulations) saving surface from the front but have also been lengthened on the inside of the leg to extended the calf protection and give another increased saving surface. The inner cell has been shaped to fit the leg but is made from heat sensitive foam which moulds under pressure and will fit the shape of the individual GK within the first couple of weeks of use. Finally the new strapping system has fully replaceable buckles (both male and female parts) and comfort pads to again enhance fit and reduce twisting.\nThe gloves also feature increased protection whilst keeping their weight below the other international level pads in the market. The four layer front pad on the left hand gives incredible protection with the internal shaping offering specific grippoints to enhance fit, but also ensuring the glove is positioned correctly to maximise the rebound created. A harder foam layer is sandwiched between softer foam to utilise the natural characteristics of an open cell foam, the microscopic air pockets are compressed under force (ball impact) and then return to shape, propelling the ball away after impact (returning energy). The righthand is shaped to give a maximum size saving surface. The wrist area is sculpted to offer flexibility to ensure that the forearm is protected in general play, but the angles required for ground saves and use of the stick are also maintained. The internal shaping of the right hand offers high levels of protection at specific stress points and anchor points to ensure that the stick and glove fit and function well together.", "id": "<urn:uuid:7fa3802e-c2ce-4345-b8c0-3a95f7a89d71>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2020-45", "url": "https://www.mercianhockey.eu/collections/goalkeeping/products/elite-legguards", "date": "2020-10-28T17:45:03Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2020-45/segments/1603107900200.97/warc/CC-MAIN-20201028162226-20201028192226-00160.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9411104917526245, "token_count": 658}, "content": [{"line": "ELITE GOALKEEPING KIT SIZING HAS CHANGED.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "When we launched the kit in 2019 it was designed for bigger \u2018keepers.

The inner cell has been shaped to fit the leg but is made from heat sensitive foam which moulds under pressure and will fit the shape of the individual GK within the first couple of weeks of use. Finally the new strapping system has fully replaceable buckles (both male and female parts) and comfort pads to again enhance fit and reduce twisting.", "label": "technical description", "split": false}, {"line": "The gloves also feature increased protection whilst keeping their weight below the other international level pads in the market. The four layer front pad on the left hand gives incredible protection with the internal shaping offering specific grippoints to enhance fit, but also ensuring the glove is positioned correctly to maximise the rebound created. A harder foam layer is sandwiched between softer foam to utilise the natural characteristics of an open cell foam, the microscopic air pockets are compressed under force (ball impact) and then return to shape, propelling the ball away after impact (returning energy). The righthand is shaped to give a maximum size saving surface. The wrist area is sculpted to offer flexibility to ensure that the forearm is protected in general play, but the angles required for ground saves and use of the stick are also maintained. The internal shaping of the right hand offers high levels of protection at specific stress points and anchor points to ensure that the stick and glove fit and function well together.", "label": "technical description", "split": false}]}

{"doc": {"text": "There are 5 campground loops at Johnson Shut-Ins, a Missouri state park. We stayed in Loop 2, the loop with full hook up sites. The sites were very spacious and level. There are a number of pull through sites; although, we didn\u2019t have one. There is a gravel trail which runs all through the campground which is great for walking and provides an easy access to the campground\u2019s facilities.\nThere is no wi-fi or over the air tv channels available, so we brought some DVDs for nightly entertainment. There is a campground store which was open only on weekends during our fall stay. Next to the store is a very nice laundry facility. This is a most pleasant place to camp.\n2. Visit the Shut-Ins\nThe main draw of the park is the shut-ins area. There is a concrete path from the campground to the shut-ins. However, it is 3.74 miles to the \u201centrance\u201d to the shut-ins area, and then it is a small hike to the shut-ins. We felt it too far to walk, so we drove to the shut-ins area parking lot and walked in from there. There is a second store located here, and in front is a beautiful stone mural depicting nature in the Ozarks. We enjoyed the fall colors during our visit, a time when the park is a bit more peaceful. In the summer, this state park can become very crowded as people love playing in, what is commonly called, nature\u2019s water park. Water shoes are a must along with a ton of caution. We saw two people slip on the rocks while walking just a bit into the water. Good thing they didn\u2019t hit their heads! My pictures don\u2019t do the justice to the beauty of the area, but here are just a few to give you an idea.\n3. Visit the Black River Visitor Center\nOne day, we walked the concrete path from the campground to the Visitor Center. It took us a good 45 minutes one way. The nice thing is the path goes under the state highway, so no worries about crossing the sometimes busy road. We enjoyed the walk immensely. We also enjoyed looking at the displays in the Visitor Center, including some short videos. The Visitor Center is on the bottom floor of the building. There are also some nice displays out front.\n4. Visit Elephant Rocks State Park\nThis day-use state park is about 14 miles from Johnson Shut-Ins, and we visited there on our best weather day. We visited this Missouri state park on a Wednesday, and we were surprised at the number of cars in the parking lot. However, we were able to practice social distancing without any issues. The walk through the elephant rocks is a paved trail which is about one mile long. There are a couple of alternate paths which ensures the path is wheelchair accessible. Right off the parking lot, there are a number of picnic tables among the boulders. After our hike, we enjoyed this area to eat lunch and to play some Scrabble. While sitting here, we saw a young girl with her grandmother walk in, both carrying sketchbooks. Later, they showed us their drawings which were excellent. What a nice activity to enjoy together and connect the generations.\n5. Visit Battle of Pilot Knob \u2013 State Historic Site\nThis state historic site is in Pilot Knob, about 15 miles away. It is a smaller museum which offers a number of displays as well as 2 movies to watch. This site preserves an important civil war battle. There is an outside walking trail; however, it was a very cold and windy day. So, we hope to do the outside activities on a future visit.\nPilot Knob is in the area known as \u201cArcadia Valley\u201d, and it is a beautiful area in Missouri. I can\u2019t help but remember how my grandmother, who was born in 1898, talked about how she visited Pilot Knob as a young girl. She told me many times, she \u201chiked those hills morning through night.\u201d She also said she was with some lady, maybe Mrs. Bogart, who carried a gun on those hikes. For what, I don\u2019t know. Maybe because of snakes \u2013 or bears? My grandma lived in St. Louis, so I wonder how she got to Pilot Knob \u2013 horse or train? I will have to ask family members if they recall any more to the story.\n6. Go out to Eat\nFor dinner one night, we drove back to Pilot Knob. We ate at Baylee Jo\u2019s BBQ, and it was delicious. It was recommended to us by a fellow camper, and it was a great recommendation. There is also a Save-A-Lot right across the street which we popped into for some groceries.\nMy post describes just a few things to do in and around Johnson Shut-Ins.

Blood glucose control with insulin prevents hyperglycemia but is associated with an increased incidence of hypoglycemia and may not affect blood glucose variability. Implementation strategies of blood glucose control with insulin in critically ill patients have mainly used manually operated whole blood portable glucose meters. These meters are impracticable, possibly unsafe, and time\u2013 and blood\u2013consuming. Utilization of subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring has the potential to improve the safety (i.e., prevention of hypoglycemia) and effectiveness (i.e., obtain a higher percent of values in the therapeutic range and less blood glucose variability) of insulin titration in critically ill patients. In addition, utilization of subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring devices is less time\u2013 and blood\u2013consuming than the use of manually operated whole blood portable glucose meters. Medtronic has developed a subcutaneous continuous glucose\u2013monitoring system especially for critically ill patients, called the Sentrino\u00ae.\n1. The primary objective of this study is to determine the accuracy of subcutaneous CGM glucose measurements as compared with current standard of care blood glucose levels measurements;\n2. The secondary objective of this study is to train healthcare workers to use of the Medtronic Sentrino\u00ae system, and to obtain feedback from the users on the usability of the Medtronic Sentrino\u00ae system.\nThis study concerns an investigator\u2013initiated observational implementation study in critically ill patients subjected to blood glucose control with insulin, aiming at a blood glucose level between 90 and 150 mg/dL.\nCritically ill patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU) of the Academic Medical Center at the University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nThe intervention exists of use of Sentrino\u00ae.\nMain study parameters/endpoints:\nThe main study parameter is the accuracy of subcutaneous CGM glucose measurements.\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:\nThe Sentrino\u00ae has been tested and validated in a number of pre\u2013clinical and clinical studies in patients outside the intensive care unit (ICU), and has been found to be safe and accurate for trend. Potential benefits include reduced risk of hypoglycemia, and decreased glycemic variability. Burden and risks include local irritations, bleeding and infection at the site of the sensor.\n|- Main changes (audit trail)|\n|- RECORD||30-jan-2013 - 9-feb-2013|", "id": "<urn:uuid:362ea3fb-c7be-486f-8a52-54fafdb5ccb3>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2016-30", "url": "http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3827", "date": "2016-07-24T02:53:12Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-30/segments/1469257823935.18/warc/CC-MAIN-20160723071023-00057-ip-10-185-27-174.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.8433485627174377, "token_count": 1298}, "content": [{"line": "|- candidate number||14295|", "label": "tabular data", "split": false}, {"line": "|- NTR Number||NTR3827|", "label": "tabular data", "split": false}, {"line": "|- ISRCTN||ISRCTN wordt niet meer aangevraagd.|", "label": "tabular data", "split": false}, {"line": "|- Date ISRCTN created|", "label": "lack of context", "split": false}, {"line": "|- date ISRCTN requested|", "label": "lack of context", "split": false}, {"line": "|- Date Registered NTR||30-jan-2013|", "label": "date without context", "split": false}, {"line": "|- Secondary IDs||NL41498.018.12 / 2012_211; CCMO / METC AMC|", "label": "tabular data", "split": false}, {"line": "|- Public Title||Usability of Subcutaneous Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Critically Ill Patients.|", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "|- Scientific Title||Usability of Subcutaneous Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Critically Ill Patients.|", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "|- hypothesis||The aim of this study is to test the accuracy and usability of the Medtronic Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (Sentrino\u00ae) in an ICU\u2013environment, and includes testing the usability of all the components.|", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "|- Healt Condition(s) or Problem(s) studied||Blood glucose, Monitoring, Critically ill patients|", "label": "tabular data", "split": false}, {"line": "|- Inclusion criteria||1.

{"doc": {"text": "Submitted by Alison Marrelli\nThe Angel Baby Fund began after this year\u2019s Angel Baby Walk raised enough funds to help local families cover funeral expenses for their beloved children. The organizers hoped the funds would last until the next walk in spring of 2017, but our Carbon and Emery families have lost five children so far this year and funds were quickly depleted to help each of them.\nThe walk will continue to be an annual event to come together and remember our Angel Babies.

{"doc": {"text": "Okay, maybe no need for such a dramatic title but it was certainly not for the faint-hearted and something I will remember for the rest of my life. During a liveaboard in Cuba, I was able to float nose to nose with El Nino the American crocodile, something I never thought I\u2019d do.\nAs an experienced diver I am familiar with being in the presence of sharks, from reef sharks to larger more intimidating sharks. Diving with large sharks in numbers with the odd close encounter, you begin to see how they behave and their reaction to you as a diver, being this foreign species that was not born to be an ocean inhabitant. After a few sharky dives you develop a trust and understanding, learning how to conduct yourself around sharks becomes second nature, they become a familiar and welcome sight.\nCrocodiles, on the other hand, are far from a familiar sighting and not even thought about when it comes to diving. When I saw this was a possibility at a location I was looking at booking, it really did seal the deal, then the countdown began.\nWhere in the world is this possible you may ask, while I\u2019m sure similar encounters can be found elsewhere, mine took place in Cuba, in \u2018La Jardines De La Reina\u2019. The Gardens of the Queen, as it\u2019s otherwise known, is a huge reef system on the south side of Cuba, with pristine reefs, plenty of sharks and beautiful surroundings. It really has to be the best of the Caribbean, being well preserved by limiting visiting diver numbers to the hundreds per year.\nThe days leading up to the liveaboard I was very excited, not only to see such a beautiful location underwater but about my future encounter and how it was going to play out. On board our boat the prospect of being in the water with a croc didn\u2019t seem to be much of a talking point, however, for me it was going to be the highlight of the week.\nAfter a few days diving we were moored in mangrove territory and I knew the introduction with Nino was drawing closer. We were told we would alternate so the other group would head out in the morning first thing and we would go after our morning dive. During the dive I was mostly wondering what was happening in the mangroves and whether the other group seeing him first would mean he would disappear after having his fill of human interaction for the day. Other thoughts would be wondering if crocodiles were like sharks in the sense you have a better chance of meeting them early morning.\nAs we returned to the main boat the others had just got back and were still standing around the dive deck, I was looking for excited, smiling faces of joy and achievement but saw none. It turns out El Nino had evaded them and was not to be seen after searching for the best part of an hour. Now I was nervous our chance to have this once in a lifetime experience was slipping away. I think the decision was made to wait a while before heading straight back out, and I\u2019m glad we did\u2026\u2026.\nEl Nino \u2013 The Encounter\nAfter hoping and praying Nino would now be less busy, or more sociable and willing to be found by us, we set off on our hunt through the mangroves. After a few minutes of nothing but silence and the beauty of the mangroves, I was starting to feel hopeless again. We went round in a few circles and the crew started their chanting, \u201cNee nee ooo, nee nee ooo\u201d, a tune I\u2019m sure they had rehearsed together. Another 10 or 15 minutes went by with us singing Nino\u2019s symphony, no sign of movement, no ripples, nothing\u2026\nWe finally conceded unwillingly and started to head back to base, when just then, like some miracle, out of the middle of the mangroves comes the star of the show, it was El Nino! There he was, propelling his fine Jurassic self towards our boat, in that swaying motion these amphibians do so well. He was an American crocodile and a good size, between the 2.5 to 3 metre mark, not nearly as big as some crocs but for everyone on the boat, easily big enough! The time was now\u2026.\nEveryone on the boat cheers and there\u2019s a look of relief in captain\u2019s eyes, we were about to do the unthinkable. It was a similar feeling to what I\u2019d had before any potential life threatening activity like a bungee or parachute jump. It suddenly sinks in that we CHOSE to do this and were in the here and now, there was a crocodile within a metre from the boat and we were about to get into it\u2019s domain for fun, thrills, photo ops, overcome some fear, all manner of possible reasons.\nWe get our snorkel gear on and camera gear ready, we are advised to slip into the water quietly on the other side of the boat. We get to witness Nino being lowered in some chicken and get first row seats watching as his huge powerful jaw snaps up the chicken and swallows it in an instant. While I don\u2019t agree with feeding wild animals in this way, I was naive to think this kind of activity can happen any other way. As the first guest slips in, camera in hand, it becomes apparent none of the crew would be accompanying us to supervise what was about to happen. This was a little unsettling at first but in some ways reassuring, assuming it meant there was really zero chance if anything going wrong. Fortunately we were a small group, I was second in and soon had my solo interaction with Nino. It was a strange mix of feeling safe, with the crew being so nonchalant, while remembering that this is still a wild animal that by no means has to mimic it\u2019s previous encounters by being relaxed, trading it\u2019s being there for portions of chicken. As I dare to get closer, which in the end was very close, I think at one time I had my camera dome no more than 4 inches from his jaws. When you see the teeth from a snorkelling pov you really appreciate how big and intimidating they are, beginning to wonder what would happen if Nino decided he wanted to try something other than chicken. As I held onto the side of the boat, I could see others had now entered the water, no doubt this made me feel safer, after all this was unknown territory, I didn\u2019t know what to do or not to do around these creatures. It was surreal being so close to him, especially with portions of chicken being lowered between us, thankfully his jaw-eye co-ordination was spot on.\nIt became a struggle holding onto the boat, a surprising amount of current ripped through the mangroves, trying it\u2019s best to loosen my grip and wash me straight into Nino\u2019s awaiting jaws. As he stayed in the same spot for the most part (where the chicken was being delivered), I felt the need to rotate for someone else so come into my position, but I could have stayed there for hours taking it all in. As I moved round to his side I could now see a new angle, his long muscly body and tail, a real life dinosaur. A few more minutes passed before it was time to get back on board, by the end we got to see him swim around a little, getting a little jittery whenever he came in close. We climbed back up onto the boat fully intact and waved Nino goodbye as we headed back to our larger vessel.\nThe experience with Nino was exceptional, I would have loved to go back another time and see him, he was a gentle giant. Although the rest of the diving was outstanding, this half an hour was a huge highlight of the trip and something truly unforgettable. Amongst all the excitement and moments of fear I was able to come away with some great shots too. Happy days!\nIf you are reading this for a detailed explanation of how to use Adobe Lightroom or extensive tips on editing, then please wait for my next blog which will cover some aspects in more detail. This is more an explanation of why to even edit in the first place, while trying to show how simple [\u2026]\nRemember the movie \u2018Jurassic Park\u2019? Well, Cocos Island was actually the inspiration behind the fictional Jurassic counterpart \u2018Isla Nublar\u2019 If you\u2019ve seen the movie you\u2019ll know that this means cloud forests, a spectacular green mountainous landscape, numerous waterfalls and wonderfully blue water.

{"doc": {"text": "It\u2019s a standard piece of cynicism that the addition of a qualifier to a field of study means that said study ends up not being in that field at all. \u201cSocial justice\u201d is, for example, quite divorced from the usual standards of \u201cjustice\u201d, \u201csocial sciences\u201d are not known for their adherence to the strictures of \u201cscience\u201d. And it appears that we need to add another to our list, \u201ceducational\u201d economics seems not to be about economics. The background is that in Australia there\u2019s a debate about what interest rate ought to be charged to students on the loans they take out to go to university. One \u201ceducational\u201d economist has insisted that the idea of fixing that interest rate to that on government bonds will lead to poorer earners paying much more over the life of their loans than those with higher incomes. Something that\u2019s entirely true by the way, as higher earners will pay off the loans more swiftly. But to look at such loans purely on the interest to be paid might be an accounting exercise, might even be a useful banking exercise, but it\u2019s not obviously an economic report.\nThe federal government is expected to ditch one of its most controversial budget measures \u2013 the plan to apply real interest rate to student debts \u2013 following advice from the architect of the HECS repayment scheme that it is unfair to poor graduates.\nDetailed modelling by leading education economist Bruce Chapman has found poor graduates could pay 30 per cent more for a degree than their high-income counterparts if the government indexes student debts at the government bond rate rather than inflation.\nIn more detail:\nProfessor Chapman\u2019s modelling found low-income graduates (those in the bottom 30 per cent of earners) would amass total repayments of $105,000 from a starting debt of $60,000 under the government\u2019s plan.\nBy contrast, high-income graduates (those in the top 25 per cent of earners) would pay only $75,000 in total repayments on the same debt \u2013 $30,000 less than low-income earners.\nGraduates on a median salary would pay around $82,000 in repayments on the same starting debt.\nAll of that is entirely true: simply because repayments are linked to earnings. The more you earn the more you pay back of the debt each month or year and thus the faster you pay off the outstanding principal. And it\u2019s hardly a surprise that the longer you borrow money for the more interest you pay: no one at all complains that we pay more interest on a 30 year mortgage than we do on a 15 year one. But this is an accounting or possibly even a banking treatment of the question, not an economic one, for it manages to miss two highly relevant economic points.\nThe first being that this idea that we want people to go to university is that they will become more productive as a result of going to university. If people take out a loan to become mining engineers and then go and make $200,000 a year in the mines then we think that\u2019s great. Value is being added in the form of human capital and the whole society becomes richer. But if someone takes out $60,000 in loans to then go and become a diversity adviser earning a very much smaller sum then it\u2019s not at all obvious that this is a good deal for society. Has enough value been added to cover that capital investment? And of course it is exactly this difficulty in the valuation of different degrees which leads to the idea that students should borrow themselves for their education rather than taxpayers paying for it all. Put the decision about whether going to university or not, also the one of what to study, into the hands of the person who both gains the benefits and also has to carry the costs.\nWhich leads to us being quite happy with the idea that the costs to do a course that leads to a low productivity career are higher than the costs of doing something more productive. For recall, the more productive all of our fellows are the richer we all are collectively. That\u2019s actually the argument in favour of having an education system at all.\nWhich is our first economics point: we like a system that encourages people to decide upon high productivity courses and careers rather than low productivity ones.\nThe second economic point is that there\u2019s a great gaping hole in the analysis. That hole being \u201ctax\u201d. The point being that Australia has a progressive income tax system. Someone in the top 25% of the income distribution, that person who pays off that student loan faster and thus pays less interest, is going to be paying income tax at a marginal rate of 37 to 45%. That person who is in that bottom 30% of earners will be paying that same tax at marginal rates of nothing through 19% to 32.5%. So because we\u2019ve already got a progressive income tax system we\u2019ve already dealt with the idea that the rich pay more. We don\u2019t thus need to be adjusting interest rates on loans: we\u2019ve already dealt with that inherent unfairness of some people being able to earn more money than others.\nAll of which is where this distinction between \u201ceducational\u201d economics and economics itself seems to come in. As Bastiat told us, the point of economics, even of an economist, is to look at the things that are hidden. And it\u2019s not as if the existence of the income tax system should come as a surprise to anyone.

{"doc": {"text": "Monthly Archives: July 2012\nYesterday I rang my mobile phone provider to bleat something about \u2018when am I out of my contract, please sir?\u2019\nThe stern reply was not yet, but you could talk to someone to see what we could do, yada, yada, yada; blah, blah, blah.\nI couldn\u2019t be bothered with it, so I just muttered something about wanting shot of the Crapberry, thanks anyway, and hung up. My main beef with said item is it sticks on \u2018O\u2019 or \u2018+\u2019 and often times it is a battle to get something out there not full of ooooooooooooooooo s or ++++++++++++++++++ s. Plus it freezes. A lot. Oh and the camera is terrible.\nWithin an hour, I had an email from RIM, the makers of the Crapberry (apt manufacturers name, I think), imploring me to consider upgrading to the new SuperCrackCrapBerry.\nWell, they did for me anyway. At first, I was full of cynicism. Oh a green hill, and, oh, a hymn *shudders*. Then Kenneth Branagh doing Isambard Kingdom Brunel, whilst quoting Shakespeare, in a top hat and \u2018scary facial whiskers\u2019 (to quote my daughter) bothered my sensibilities somewhat and the grubby working classes, well worked\u2026 until, the five Olympic rings were forged before my eyes and raised above the stadium and then, you might say, we were all on the same page. That sentence took some writing. Not unlike the time (cubed) it took for me to catch up with the vision.\nThere\u2019s no need for me to catalogue what came next is there? All I want to say really, is this. The time passed awfully quickly and when Muhammad Ali faltered onto the stage I cried.\nI didn\u2019t cry a little, I cried a lot. I have mentioned Ali on here before, mainly as a beautiful individual and a lyrical gangster. The night before the opening ceremony I had coincidentally waved his photo biography at a small audience and extolled his many qualities, lest they troubled to forget.\nThen last night, as if by magic, there he was. He looks so different from his prime. It\u2019s more than age, it\u2019s the ravages of the cruel neurological disease that is Parkinson\u2019s, a disease that afflicted my grandfather. Last night, I had to look and look again to be sure, \u2018Is that Muhammad Ali?\u2019 And then, when Ali moved to touch the Olympic flag, suddenly, time and space collapsed and so did I. In that Olympic moment I was a child again, watching Ali in black and white on the portable tv, listening to his patter and his press conferences. I was reading him, occasionally writing about or quoting him, over a lifetime. I was the age I am now, waving his picture to strangers and I was all I can ever try to be, somehow incredibly knowing shared humanity, connected through all our wondrous possibilities.\nI am nothing to Muhammad Ali, and he is nothing and no-one and everything and everyone to me. How much easier for a man of his age, and frailty to stay at home out of the public\u2019s gaze, than fly to London for a late night gig. But despite the disease, the age, the infirmity and confusion, he is the same as he ever was, because he was there. There, still fighting his battle, on the world stage. And to me, that is the Greatest Ever Inspiration any of us could wish for.\nHe who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.\nThe Olympic torch came through our town a few weeks ago. It was a wet day; the children were allowed time off school to see this once in a lifetime event with their families. I took my two girls, who were distinctly underwhelmed; in fact they spent a lot of time moaning.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter though, they saw it and the youngest took the photograph of the torch bearer as she had the best view. I haven\u2019t parented outside the 21st century so I can\u2019t compare the job with that of my parents, or theirs, but I suspect every generation faces its own unique challenges, as well as some in common. I believe as parents, all that you can do, is provide the opportunity for them and let them make of it what they will.\nI wrote this to myself as a reminder, for when things get tough, as they always do.\nYou cannot have all of it\nUse your wisdom\nLet go of something, or something will let go of you.\nAt least if you take the former option you have the choice\nTake photographs. You cannot have too many.\nWhatever you hope to remember you will most assuredly forget\nDo one thing at a time \u2013 you will get less done, better\nIf you\u2019re in the room, be in the room\nMake time to leave the room.

A walk\u2019s not the same without a dog.\nI didn\u2019t take this photo \u2013 it was taken on a Samsung S2 mobile phone. Not bad at all.\nThis blog has been a longtime critic of the government, mainly because they don\u2019t seem to have a clue what they are doing. And when they do have a reasonable idea, they put in ridiculously short time limits to see results, so that they can claim the credit in time for the next election (I am thinking of the Work Programme and the pilot programmes for reducing re-offending here, where funding is dependent on outcomes, but also set within unrealistic time frames, equivalent to the lifespan of a flea).\nTheir one idea for the economy, the notorious Plan A, is dead in the water. It\u2019s greatest proponent George Osborne is on the missing list, and he seems to have taken even deeper cover since the IMF wagged their finger at him yesterday. On all previous known form, he\u2019ll take about five days to think about what he\u2019s going to say next and since he\u2019s not due an annual Mansion House speech for another year, it might be even longer. Then there\u2019s Michael Gove\u2019s new phonics based \u2018reading\u2019 test (actually an exercise in decoding sounds) which is failing competent children who read for understanding and meaning. Incidentally, Mr Gove, trying to teach the latter to adults is a tough gig, whereas the sounds \u2013 well those are child\u2019s play\u2026 As for Theresa and Jeremy and Dave et al \u2013 well would you? Knowing what you know now? Dave\u2019s autumn cabinet reshuffle is going to have to introduce Willy Wonka himself to to turn this thing around.\nI suppose they were banking on the Jubilee and the Olympic summer saving their collective bacon and bringing back the feelgood factor to the populace (also on the missing list, probably in George Osborne\u2019s back pocket), but the Gulf jetstream, the bus drivers, train drivers and Border Agency staff, not forgetting G4S, had their own ideas about that. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I hope the Olympics goes off well, for the sake of the athletes and for the rest of us that have had to pay for the effing thing (just don\u2019t think about Greece ok?). On the other hand, I can\u2019t help but have a few reservations (still don\u2019t think about Greece). Arguing about surface to air missiles on the roof, when god knows how many G4S uniforms have gone AWOL? It\u2019s really not cool. I have a fantastic colleague at work, she\u2019s from Hull and she\u2019s a no-nonsense Northern lass who produces spot-on stuff, including colour-coded spreadsheets for everything. She\u2019d have organised the Olympics, on budget, on time, with security, no problem. I think if she\u2019d been in charge you might have even been able to get in wearing a Pepsi t-shirt\u2026\nAnd that\u2019s my problem with the government, right there, in a nutshell. My colleague is operating well within her comfort zone, she has a lot more to offer, in fact. The government are collectively suffering from the Peter Principle \u2013 where employees rise to their level of incompetence. And the problem for us is that it\u2019s not just one of them, it\u2019s bloody well all of them. They are too young, too arrogant, insufficiently wise and lacking in substance to do the job properly. The facts are that they can barely run this country. Sadly, the default setting of desperate clinging on to power will probably see the coalition stagger on to the next election; the Lib Dems will be finished after that and the Tories will hopefully be chased back into their historical blue lands. I for one, cannot wait. And I\u2019m hoping that Miliband et al have the sense to learn from the mistakes of others before they inevitably start making their own, as we all do.\nIn the meantime, whilst we suffer the horrors of the British summer, the mish mash of the coalition\u2019s blue and yellow colour combo and also those pretty disgusting Olympic mascots Wenlock and Mandeville , I would really like to have Spitting Image back on Sunday night.\nThat would really cheer me up.", "id": "<urn:uuid:f3041bc3-086b-4406-8522-368f39d361f7>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2019-35", "url": "https://onwishesandhorses.wordpress.com/2012/07/", "date": "2019-08-25T02:18:12Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-35/segments/1566027322170.99/warc/CC-MAIN-20190825021120-20190825043120-00400.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9612585306167603, "token_count": 3296}, "content": [{"line": "Monthly Archives: July 2012", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Yesterday I rang my mobile phone provider to bleat something about \u2018when am I out of my contract, please sir?\u2019", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "The stern reply was not yet, but you could talk to someone to see what we could do, yada, yada, yada; blah, blah, blah.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "I couldn\u2019t be bothered with it, so I just muttered something about wanting shot of the Crapberry, thanks anyway, and hung up.

We are now saying we are adventure travelers \u2013 but swinging by our daughter\u2019s to spend as much time as possible with our grandson.\nThis is a short blog as I prepare to tell more about our transition into full time retirement! But first, I always love to see what the Bible says about whatever we are doing. So here are a few of my favorite scriptures (all from ESV) to read as one thinks about retiring, from http://www.openbible.info/topics/retirement:\n\u201cFor I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.\u201d\n\u201cBut I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, \u2018This applies to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall come to do duty in the service of the tent of meeting. And from the age of fifty years they shall withdraw from the duty of the service and serve no more. They minister to their brothers in the tent of meeting by keeping guard, but they shall do no service. Thus shall you do to the Levites in assigning their duties.'\u201d\n\u201cA good man leaves an inheritance to his children\u2019s children, but the sinner\u2019s wealth is laid up for the righteous.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.\u201d\n2 Timothy 4:7\n\u201cI have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.\u201d\n\u201cThe plans of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord. All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs the spirit. Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established. The Lord has made everything for its purpose, even the wicked for the day of trouble. Everyone who is arrogant in heart is an abomination to theLord; be assured, he will not go unpunished.\u201d\n\u201cBlessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers. The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;\u2026\nUntil next time\u2026", "id": "<urn:uuid:9d18ee47-7cd4-4d00-8220-9a7d1ba7ab38>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2022-21", "url": "https://thetumblelees.me/2014/02/24/chapter-28-starting-adventure-travel/?like_comment=110&_wpnonce=4688b9cd2c", "date": "2022-05-19T06:22:11Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2022-21/segments/1652662525507.54/warc/CC-MAIN-20220519042059-20220519072059-00400.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9809263348579407, "token_count": 1431}, "content": [{"line": "What do you think of when you hear the term, Adventure Travel?

A glass of wine or other alcoholic drink can lower inhibitions and help us relax, or temporarily relieve the stress of a difficult event. URMC Therapist Kevin Coffey warns, if you\u2019re feeling blue in the midst of the merrymaking, think twice before downing a few drinks. Alcohol may actually make you feel worse.\nYou may be surprised to learn that alcohol is a depressant. Many people think the opposite because drinking gives them a \u201cpick-me-up.\u201d The truth is that alcohol depresses your central nervous system and brain. That temporarily blunts the effects of stress hormones. But it also slows your coordination, reaction time, and intellectual ability. When the alcohol wears off, there's a rebound effect, bringing on more stress and depression than you felt before the first sip.\nAlcohol and Depression: A Devious Duo\nBoth men and women can have problems with depression and alcohol. With men, the alcohol use usually comes first. Alcohol impacts two brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) linked to depression\u2014serotonin and norepinephrine. The more you drink and raise your blood alcohol content, the more this negative effect increases. In fact, symptoms of depression may occur with blood alcohol content levels as low as 0.03\u2014about one to two drinks.\nSwitch to Soft Drinks\nIf you have any symptoms of depression, skip the alcohol and toast with a soft drink. Depression is a serious health problem that\u2019s on the rise in the U.S. In the past 15 years, the number of people seeking treatment for depression has doubled. Left untreated, it can lead to other health problems and even suicide.\nIf these symptoms hit close to home, you may be depressed:\nSleeping more or having trouble sleeping\nOvereating or loss of appetite\nNot enjoying things that used to bring you pleasure, including sex\nIrritability, feeling hopeless or helpless\nFeelings of worthlessness\nReoccurring thoughts of death, including thoughts of suicide\nWhere to Turn for Help\nIf you have any of the symptoms of depression, get help.

So how would they know that Oreo cookies or Gillette shaving gel are actually linked to rainforest destruction?\u201d Said Dr Amy Moas, Greenpeace Senior Forest Campaigner. \u201cWe have evidence that palm oil supplier Wilmar International, which sells to these household brands, sources from companies who are complicit in the destruction oftiger habitat. This must stop before Sumatran tigers go from endangered to extinct.\u201d\nGreenpeace has evidence of trade by Wilmar with companies whose operations include illegal forest clearance and fires on peatland, like the ones that smothered Singapore in smog last summer. The report also documents harvests from illegal oil palm plantations within Tesso Nilo National Park \u2013 which is meant to be protected due to its unique plants and wildlife \u2013 that have previously been tracked to Wilmar\u2019s own mills and continue to feed into Indonesia\u2019s palm oil supply chain. Palm oil plantations are driving the destruction of Tesso Nilo National Park, of which only a quarter now remains, according to Greenpeace\u2019s mapping analysis.\nGreenpeace\u2019s investigations reveal that household names including Colgate Palmolive, Mondelez International, biofuels giant Neste Oil, Procter & Gamble and several other companies are purchasing dirty palm oil that is laundered onto the global market by Wilmar.\nAlthough Wilmar has undertaken to preserve high conservation value (HCV) forests and peatland on its own concessions, these areas supply less than 4% of the palm oil it trades and refines, with the remainder being produced by third-party suppliers. Wilmar has no proper systems in place to ensure traceability in their supply chains.\nThe palm oil sector is the largest driver of deforestation in Indonesia and the vast majority of the forest cleared in identified oil palm concessions in Sumatra during 2009\u20132011 was tiger habitat. The plantation sector is the chief threat to Sumatran tigers, with up to 1 million hectares of prime tigerhabitat already allocated to concessions.\n\u201cAs the world\u2019s biggest player in the palm oil sector, Wilmar has the power to transform the industry. Wilmar needs to commit to a no-deforestation policy, so that U.S. companies can be sure that they\u2019re not contributing to rainforest destruction or the death of tigers in Indonesia.\u201d Said Moas.\nNote to editor:\n- The report \u201cLicence to Kill\u201d can be viewed at: www.greenpeace.org/licencetokill\nMedia contact / for Interviews with Dr. Amy Moas:\nPhotos & News clipreel available at:", "id": "<urn:uuid:edecf098-a07a-4fa4-bd57-e8f87bfe658e>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2016-30", "url": "http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/greenpeace-catches-palm-oil-giant-wilmar-in-forest-scandal/", "date": "2016-07-25T20:08:59Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-30/segments/1469257824345.69/warc/CC-MAIN-20160723071024-00190-ip-10-185-27-174.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9339490532875061, "token_count": 678}, "content": [{"line": "Greenpeace Catches Palm Oil Giant Wilmar in Forest Scandal", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "San Francisco, 21 October, 2013 - Household brands that source palm oil through Singapore-based palm oil trader Wilmar International, such as Mondelez (makers of Oreo cookies) and Procter & Gamble (makers of Gillette shaving products) are making consumers unwitting accomplices in the destruction of Indonesia\u2019s forests, and pushing critically endangered species like the Sumatran tiger to the edge of extinction, revealed Greenpeace International today in new investigations.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u201cMany people don\u2019t realize there\u2019s palm oil in all kinds of everyday products \u2013 from cookies to shampoo.

{"doc": {"text": "At midday a light snow began to fall; the white was a welcome sight. While parts of the country are shoveling out, we here in southwest Wisconsin have needed only a broom. The ground here has been bare most of the winter. It's been great for the farmers who try to get their corn and soybeans harvested before the snow flies.\nBy late afternoon there was an inch of new white snow on everything--the ground, trees, fence posts, bushes, everywhere. It was nice to see something bright. In Wisconsin, winter just doesn't seem like winter without some snow. I've been itching to slide down a hill on a sled, but I need at least three or four inches before it's soft enough to cushion these old bones. The birds at the birdfeeders seemed extra busy this morning. Blue jays called and flew off in several directions. A pair of cardinals flew by me as I stood in the snow. A gang of black crows sailed high overhead, calling out to me as they passed by.\nI noticed a pair of jay-sized birds coming at me from the south and passing right over my head. There was no doubt they were robins. This was a nice treat, even though I saw them for only a few seconds. I think the birds knew there was snow on the way, and when they are busy, they tend to add more life at the start of a day. I broomed the snow off the woodpile and picked up three heavy chunks of split hickory. As I climbed the steps, I wondered where those two robins were headed and where they have been. I can't remember the last time I didn't see a robin in the winter, but it's been at least five years. Seeing the first return of a robin in the spring is not so shocking when you know a few are hanging around all winter. These winter robins are shy and rarely will come to the bird feeders. They prefer to fend for themselves, and they are good at it. They will gladly eat the nutritious berries of chokecherry, wild grapes, serviceberry, and highbush cranberry, but the winter robins' favorite food is the seed found in the dark red tops of the sumac.\nOver the years I have shared many winter stories with my readers--stories of the tracks in the deep snow as the landscape turns white. For me it meant a chance to write about how the wildlife survives in a snowy world. So I, for one, am looking for more snow.\nAn Amish farmer told me the other day about seeing a large white bird on top of a fence post in a hayfield. This, of course, made me very curious, so I had to ask him some more questions. He said the bird was over a foot tall, but seemed to be huddled down over the top of the post. The bird was a hundred yards away, but it looked like there may have been some black spots on its white feathers. The farmer's excellent description was of the great white owl, also known as the snowy owl.\nIt's always a wonderful treat to see one of these magnificent birds from the far north. Life can be very harsh on the Canadian tundra, and the snowy owl is used to cold winter weather. In the spring and summer they raise their young on the treeless landscape. Food is plentiful and the owls catch voles, lemmings, and flightless young birds. When winter comes, their true hunting skills surface, and they look for hares and ptarmigan. If the hunting is bad, many of these large white owls migrate across the northern boundaries of the U.S. in search of food.\nWith their large, keen yellow eyes, snowy owls can spot their next meal at a great distance. On huge and silent white wings, they glide low to the ground and surprise their prey. The female great white owl is larger, and her feathers may be heavily barred with black, while the smaller male is lightly barred or pure white. When everything is covered with snow, the great white owl is perfectly camouflaged to blend with its surroundings. With no snow on the ground, though, the snowy owl stands out like a sore thumb. I've spotted them a mile away, sitting motionless in a tree or on top of a fence post. They truly are one of nature's most beautiful and mysterious winter birds.\nAll art \u00a92013 Organic Valley", "id": "<urn:uuid:5ab655f3-f950-433c-b46e-09a7367cc46b>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.organicvalley.coop/community/down-natures-trail/article/snowy-owl/", "date": "2013-05-24T08:37:49Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368704392896/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516113952-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.978161096572876, "token_count": 915}, "content": [{"line": "At midday a light snow began to fall; the white was a welcome sight.

{"doc": {"text": "The Brooklyn Heights Association (BHA) is responding with concern and cautious optimism to the Brooklyn Public Library\u2019s (BPL) selection of Hudson Companies/Marvel Architects for redevelopment of the Brooklyn Heights Branch of the Brooklyn Public Library.\nWe believe that the project, as outlined in the original Request for Proposals (RFP), has the potential to make a significant contribution \u2014 if the developers and BPL trustees will take the time to re-evaluate their design, and engage in an open process with the broader library and civic center community.\nThe current design gives no indication that the building houses an important civic institution \u2014 the 21st century descendant of the legendary Carnegie Libraries. Instead, what we are seeing is a clunky condominium sitting atop generic retail space. We want to see a distinctive and welcoming public building that provides a graceful transition from the civic buildings on Cadman Plaza to the residences of Brooklyn Heights \u2014 a library that is a visual gateway to the neighborhood.\nMoreover, the project can and should address broader community priorities. The decision to assign considerable square footage to an exclusive private school gymnasium does not reflect the inclusive mission of our public library system. Community or public school space is called for in lieu of a private school gym.\nOur optimism stems from the knowledge that these two firms are local businesses whose partners are well acquainted with our neighborhood: Jonathan Marvel has the ability to design a new building which truly addresses the complexities of this project on such an important site.

This is something I have been thinking about a lot lately, as I realize that my time is valuable and there are thousands of books I want to read, so why waste my time reading something I am not enjoying? However, I do think that this is easier said than done! I plan to write another post talking about why I continue reading books even when I should DNF them. I know many of us can relate to that!\nThere are also times where I will put down a book just because it is not the right time for me to read it. There is nothing inherently wrong with the book, and it may even become a favourite, but I am just not in the mood for it! I recently wrote a post talking about some of the books I want to try again some day. #moodreaderproblems\nThere are a whole host of reasons why I might DNF a book, but the major one is if I find it to be problematic in any way. I will not give a second thought to DNFing a book that is racist, sexist, transphobic, etc.\nIs there a specific trope you can\u2019t stand?\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I can appreciate a love triangle if it is done well; however, they are so often handled horribly. I struggle reading about love triangles where it is evident from the beginning who the main character is going to choose- it takes away all of the tension, mystery, and intrigue! I also dislike when one of the love interests is awful, while the other (who the protagonist will ultimately choose) is perfect in every way- it feels manipulative somehow!\nMy most disliked trope is any form of cheating in a relationship. I don\u2019t know why this bothers me so much, but I just cannot find it romantic. Once again, the current partner who is being cheated on is usually flawed, which is a way of justifying the cheating. This is so overdone and I find it frustrating! I 100% understand that relationships are complicated and not every situation is the same, but it is just not something I want to read about in a romance.\nA plot twist that will make you drop instantly?\nSomething I have noticed that is common in thrillers is the use of mental health as a plot twist. It makes me angry every single time I come across it. Unfortunately, the book is usually almost over by the time the twist is revealed! It is one of the main reasons why I am so picky about the thrillers that I read. I have been burned one too many times!\nHow many pages do you usually give a book to capture your attention?\nLisa @ Cold Brew Book Reviews on Instagram has come up with an interesting system that I am trying to put into practice. The idea is that once you have read 20% of a book, you evaluate whether or not it is currently a three star or higher. If it is not, then you DNF the book. She has even created a hashtag, which is #20percentthoughts. I think that this is so smart! Twenty percent is more than enough to know how you are feeling about a book and the writing style. I also love that this method encourages you to stop and reflect on what you are reading. I might starting sharing my 20% thoughts in future blog posts!\nHow many books do you give a series before deciding if it\u2019s worth your time?\nI have talked about this before, but I am terrible at finishing series to begin with! I usually give a series one book. If I don\u2019t enjoy the first one, I will not continue on with the series. There are some series where people say you have to read a few before they get really good, but I don\u2019t want to have to suffer through three or four books just to get to the goods ones.\nThat said, if I love the first book in a series and the second one is a disappointment, there is still a good chance that I will give the third book a try, especially if it is a trilogy. Serpent and Dove is a great example of this. I loved the first one, but Blood and Honey let me down; however, I will still read the third and final installment because I am curious enough to know how the story end.\nDo you count books as read on Goodreads if you DNF them?\nI personally do not. If I DNF a book at 20%, I do not think it is fair for me to review it. I just put it down, remove it from my TBR, and move on. It is rare for me to read more than half a book and then not finish it, but even then I don\u2019t think I would review it. The only exception would be if it was extremely problematic and I thought it was important to inform other readers of the issues I had.

{"doc": {"text": "Quick Guide to File Compression\nIf you have owned your computer for a year or more, you have probably run into the problem of large files, and hard-drive space. The salesman\u2019s promise, \u201cYou\u2019ll never use all the space on this computer!\u201d, sounds more and more like advertising. Once you actually start to use the computer for more than just the occasional game of solitaire, all of the programs, video games, and assorted emails begin to stack up. Before you know it you may start getting warning messages like, \u201cHard-drive space is running low. Do you want to clean up some files on your computer?\u201d\nOr perhaps you\u2019ve run into a situation where you\u2019ve spent hours working on a report containing lots of graphics, and charts, and some spreadsheets. You go to copy the report to a disk or send it as an email attachment, only to find that it has morphed into a 15 meg monster of a file.\nThe best way to combat these kinds of file space problems is to utilize a simple compression program. The function of a compression program is to take large files and make them smaller without changing, or losing any information in the file. It does this by using a complex set of algorithms and equations that take the bits of information in the file, reduce the size, and then remember how to put the files back together. Since a file is made up of 1000\u2019s of bits of information it can be reduced from 1000\u2019s down to 100\u2019s without losing information because an algorithm can predict where those other bits WILL go when the file is uncompressed later.\nNow of course, like everything in the computer world, there are many different compression programs out there to choose from. Even though each program uses different algorithms for their compression, they all compress files about the same. A typical compression rate for a 100k Word document containing all text is about 60%-90% of the original file size. With this in mind, choosing your own favorite compression utility is usually a matter of personal taste, and ease of use.\nOne of the most common, and user-friendly programs is called PKZIP. This program is freely available from www.PKware.com/ target=_blank>PKware. It\u2019s user interface combines functionality, with ease of use by putting the compression terminology into easy to understand terms.\nAnother highly used compression utility is called RAR. The RAR compression format is an extremely good one for packing together large programs into one very small file. One of the best features about this particular program is it\u2019s ability to take extremely large files, and spread them out over several smaller files which can be stored on individual disks. This program is available at at http://www.rarsoft.com/ target=_blank>www.RARsoft.com.\nA third extremely popular shareware compressing agent is called ARJ, and can be found at http://www.arjsoft.com/ target=_blank>www.ARJsoft.com. This program has all the same abilities as RAR, and PKZIP, but just in a different format, and file extension.\nWith the various compression utilities out there, it\u2019s nice to have more than one around so that you can open other people\u2019s files. You can only unzip a file with a .zip extension using PKZIP. A file with the .arj extension can only be opened with ARJ, and the .rar extension consequently can only be opened with the RAR program. Most files on the internet come compressed in one of these three above formats, and some sites even have 3 differently compressed copies for you to choose from all in the place.\nThe world of compression is an important one, simply for the fact that it allows us a little bit of control over the size of our computers, and the time which we spend downloading one another\u2019s files. So when those files come up that just seem bigger than you can handle, pull out your favorite compression program, and cut it down to size.", "id": "<urn:uuid:df10c21b-6a5a-479a-911a-85a017646ce9>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2019-35", "url": "https://www.westcottpress.com/resources/tipsandtricks/article.html/title/quick-guide-to-file-compression", "date": "2019-08-19T03:52:49Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-35/segments/1566027314641.41/warc/CC-MAIN-20190819032136-20190819054136-00360.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9323566555976868, "token_count": 852}, "content": [{"line": "Quick Guide to File Compression", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "If you have owned your computer for a year or more, you have probably run into the problem of large files, and hard-drive space.

{"doc": {"text": "It was great being back at St.Joseph\u2019s this week! We worked with three students I had never met before and one student who was at the last session I attended. When we walked in, one of the students (Rufus) was playing the piano. He was very talented and told us what his favorite songs to play are. It was clear that he was excited that we were interested and that he was proud of his skills. Lexi, Matt, and I commented that it would be great if he could play the piano either at some point during the performance or as the audience entered the venue.\nAll four students had also worked with the Monday group (ACT IV) so they were familiar with the plot and the characters. This was very helpful because we were able to jump right into physically acting out ACT III. Matt and I worked with Cristina and Rufus on the Viola and Olivia exchange in Scene I, while Lexi worked with Dale and Charles on Scene II. It was nice to have such a small group and be able to split up like this because we were able to give the students very personal attention. Cristina and Dale struggled a bit with reading through the lines, so as we went through I circled all the words they had a hard time with. In class yesterday, Lexi and I went through the script and attempted to change some of the words that they were struggling with to make it more approachable.\nThe only issue we really ran into was Cristina calling Dale \u2013 who had the most trouble with the script \u2013 slow and stupid. Dale didn\u2019t take her comments personally and was able to keep his sense of humor \u2013 even saying \u201cexcuse me\u201d after every time he mentioned his character (Sir Toby Belch). This provided us all with quite a bit of entertainment, and hopefully we can utilize Dales sense of humor when assigning him a role in the final production.\nOverall, it was a productive hour, and I think we all learned a lot about what our roles are going to be in the final production. Some of the students will not need our help at all but others may need more guidance and direction during the performance.

She teaches at the Genealogical Institute of Pittsburgh and the Salt Lake Institute of Genealogy. our editorial process Kimberly Powell Updated June 20, 2019 Whether your ancestors came from Argentina, Scotland, the Czech Republic, or Montana, you can access a wealth of free historical records online at FamilySearch, the genealogy arm of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It has a wealth of indexes available through its free Historical Records Collection, which includes more than 5.57 billion searchable names in 2,300+ collections from countries all over the world, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, England, Germany, France, Argentina, Brazil, Russia, Hungary, the Philippines, and many more. However, there's a lot more data available that's not searchable via a keyword, which is where the huge trove of historical document images come in. Basic Search Strategies There are so many records online at FamilySearch now that a general search often turns up hundreds if not thousands of irrelevant results. You want to be able to target your searches to wade through less chaff. If you've already tried using the \"exact search\" checkboxes next to the fields; searched birth, death, and residence places; used wildcards in names that could be spelled different ways; or tried to narrow by relationship with another person, location, or type of record already, you still have other options that can make your search more fruitful. Search by Collection A general search almost always turns up too many possibilities unless the search contains someone with a very unusual name. For best results, start by choosing a country to find collections, via the location search, or by browsing by location down to a particular record collection (e.g., North Carolina Deaths, 1906\u20131930). When you have the collection open that you want, you can use the \"narrow by\" technique within each collection (e.g., use parent surnames only to find married female children in the N.C. Deaths collection). The more possible places and connected names that you can try, the more meaningful your results will turn out to be.Take notes on the title and years of the collection you're searching, in relation to whom. If the collection is missing records from certain years, you'll know what you've been able to check\u2014and what you haven't\u2014because those missing records could come online or become searchable one day. Vary the Fields You Use The records might not have everything in them that you've typed into the \"narrow by\" fields if you've used multiple boxes, so it might not come up even if it's there. Try the search multiple ways, varying what fields you try to refine by. Use different combinations of fields. Use Wildcards and Other Search Refinements FamilySearch recognizes both the \"*\" wildcard (replaces one or more characters) and the \"?\" wildcard (replaces a single character). Wildcards can be placed anywhere within a field (even at the beginning or end of a name), and wildcard searches work both with and without the \"exact search\" checkboxes being used. You can use \"and,\" \"or,\" and \"not\" in your search fields as well as quotation marks to find exact phrases. Show a Preview After your search has returned a list of results, click on the little upside-down triangle to the right of each search result to open a more detailed preview. This reduces your time spent, versus clicking back and forth between the results list and the result pages. Filter Your Results If you're searching across multiple collections at one time, use the \"Category\" list in the left-hand navigation bar to narrow your results by category. This is useful for filtering out census records, for example, which often end up topping results lists. After you've narrowed to a particular category (\"Births, Marriages & Deaths,\" for example), the left-hand navigation bar will list record collections within that category, with the number of results that match your search query next to each collection title. Browse as Well as Search Many collections at FamilySearch are only partially searchable at any given point in time (and many are not at all), but this information isn't always easy to determine from the collection list. Even if a particular collection is searchable, compare the total number of searchable records listed in the Collections List with the total number of records available by selecting the record set and scroll down to see the number of records listed under \"View Images in This Collection.\" In many cases, you will find many records available for browsing that aren't yet included in the searchable index. Use the \"Wrong\" Documents A child's birth record can find information about his or her parents. Or, being the more recent document about the person, a death certificate could also contain his or her birthdate, if the birth certificate (or \"vital record\" or \"civil registration\") is elusive. Don't Forget Nicknames and Variants If you're searching for Robert, don't forget to try Bob. Or Margaret if you search for Peggy, Betsy for Elizabeth. Try both the maiden name and married name for women. Volunteering Hundreds of thousands of volunteers have generously donated their time to help to index the collections through FamilySearch Indexing. If you're interested in volunteering, the software is easy to download and use, and instructions are well thought out and generally self-explanatory.

{"doc": {"text": "A Life Nearly Lost\nby Bryan Gibson\nI had been asleep for nearly two hours when I received the phone call. My sixteen year-old niece, Valerie Baker, had been in a terrible car accident, leaving her in critical condition. As soon as I got off the phone, I started praying, something I\u2019m sure other family members were doing at the same time. The next day I received word that she was going to pull through, although there was the possibility that she would lose her left leg. Three days after the accident, her left leg was amputated from the middle of the knee joint. The following day successful reconstructive surgery was performed on her right knee, which had also been badly damaged in the accident. At the time of this writing, Valerie is experiencing the normal \u201clows\u201d associated with an ordeal like this, but she is very thankful to be alive. I\u2019ve done a lot of thinking over the last week about some lessons we can learn from this whole situation.\n\u00a7 Life, although a precious blessing, is very fragile and uncertain.\nAs I mentioned earlier, Valerie has had some low moments, but she is thankful to be alive. The state trooper who investigated the accident was amazed that someone survived this accident. Actually, two people did. The girl who was a passenger in the car Valerie was driving escaped with hardly a scratch, even though the car hit a tree, was split in two, and flipped a couple times. Most accidents of this magnitude do not have a \u201chappy ending.\u201d Every day people die suddenly from traffic accidents and from other causes. In other words, life is fragile; it can be taken from us in the \u201cblink of an eye.\u201d We must consider each day a blessing from God and make the very best of it (Psalms 118:24). What we must do with each day is get ready for THE DAY. Because life is so uncertain, THE DAY may come sooner than any of us expect.\n\u00a7 Life is full of sorrow (Psalms 90:10).\nI have seen more tears shed in this past week than I have seen in a long time\u2014from Valerie, from her parents, from other family members, from many of her friends who had come to check on her. It triggers a lot of emotion when you see a sixteen year-old girl lying in intensive care, with tubes running everywhere from her body. This life can be very good at times, but it can also be awfully cruel. It should make us long for that place where God will wipe away all tears, where there will be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying (Revelation 21:4).\n\u00a7 Suffering can bring out the best in people.\nIt is too early to say with certainty how Valerie will react to all that has happened to her. But what I do know about her gives me confidence that this whole ordeal will strengthen her character. This physical \u201cweakness\u201d may prove to make her stronger spiritually (2 Corinthians 12:7-10). What happened to her was a bad thing, but God has the power to make it work for good (Romans 8:28).\nThis accident has already brought out the best in other people. There is simply no way to measure the amount of compassion that has been shown to my niece and to our family. Prayers have been said, words of encouragement have been spoken, food has been cooked, money has been raised to help with expenses, and the list could go on and on.

Yes, I know she lost part of her leg, but she is alive, and I sincerely believe that we have God to thank for that. We can also give thanks to Him that she did not sustain any head injuries. In time, with the help of a prosthesis, she will be able to walk again, even run and jump again. Overcoming a brain injury would have been much tougher. Wouldn\u2019t it be terrible in a situation like this to not be able to pray with confidence, because we knew our lives were not pleasing to God\u2014to know that we so desperately needed God\u2019s help, but not have the confidence that we would receive it?

I liked the yin/yang of this arrangement, sitting in a plush lounge while looking at a nitty-gritty view, as I think it\u2019s a part of what makes Seattle, Seattle.\nWe arrived for the start of happy hour in the lounge, which offers several small plates and drinks for $5. Always a sucker for an interesting sounding cocktail, I ordered a Bellini Martini which combines elements from both drinks into one peachy libation. Made from vodka, pureed peaches and Prosecco it was refreshing and tasted of summer. M had a lemon drop (not on the happy hour menu) and said it was wonderful, too.\nFor our first course we sampled the Blue Shrimp which is served with Horseradish and Bloody Mary Dressing. The combination was outstanding. The shrimp was so fresh it tasted as if it had been just brought in especially for our order. Horseradish is finely grated over the shrimp (be careful if you are not a horseradish fan) and the dressing is served in a tiny little glass, complete with a sprig of celery.

We've all heard this, and remarkably the apple turns out ot be one of those perfect foods.

Outside of the first 10 minutes of cheesy jokes by Saturday Night Live comedian Andy Samberg, the rest of the talk has seen Zuckerberg painting a picture of a big new overhaul of profiles called \u2018Timeline.\u2019\nTimeline was described by Zuckerberg as: \u201cAll of your stories, all of your apps, a new way to express who you are.\u201d It will also integrate with mobile, to create a more seamless user experience from mobile to web. Timeline will be progressively rolled out over the next few months, and will initially look quite bare.\nThe new Facebook Timeline will be more visual and include a \u2018Cover\u2019, which is one big image to visually \"express who you are\" \u2013 which doesn\u2019t replace the profile picture. Users will also be able to be more easily go back into the archive of content and conversations since they joined Facebook. They will receive weekly or yearly Reports, which will give them a summary of events and activities they have done. The Timeline will also enable a user to Highlight an important event, update or piece of content in order to flag it up on their Timeline.\nFacebook have spent the last year working on the Open Graph protocol, which they believe will make it possible to build a completely new \u2018social class\u2019 of apps than ever before.\nThe Open Graph will open up to two additional areas. Currently, its communication, and games and will now open up to media (TV, music, movies, news and books) and lifestyle apps (cooking, eat, emotions, fashion, fitness etc.).\nOne announcement that almost got a round of applause from the audience, was that users can be engaged with an app and never have a pop up again to authorize and ask if they want to share it on their news feed again. With the new integration of Timeline and Apps, it will presume that if you want to use an app that you want to publish it on your Timeline, which is what Zuckerberg is calling a \"frictionless experience.\" Developers will be able to implement the 'add to Timeline' button on through Open Graph straight after f8, which will work immediately across all platforms.\nThe ticker feature also enables you to have a \"serendipitous experience\" with friends, particularly when it comes to music. The founder demonstrated how with Open Graph and music social network Spotify, you can listen along with friends; you see in the ticker feed that your friend is listening to Up, the new single by James Morrison you can simply hover over the alert and listen along.

{"doc": {"text": "As Believers who are seeking to advance His Kingdom we have the right and privilege to do business with God.\nWhy does He need us to do business with Him?\n1. God has given mankind dominion over the earth. Therefore, we have the authority to release Him to work when we pray. God has never violated the free will that He gave humankind. And He has given dominion over the earth to men and women.\nPsalm 8:4-8 says: \"What is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of man that You visit him? For You have made him a little lower than the angels, and You have crowned him with glory and honor. You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen\u2014even the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea that pass through the paths of the seas.\"\nGod does not violate authority. He sits above it, and He judges men when they abuse the authority given to them; and His hierarchy of authority is not the same as we often think it is. (For instance, prayers carry higher authority than leaders' decisions, and so God can turn the hearts of leaders in response to prayer.) However, He does not violate the authority He has given us. To do so would be a violation of our free will. Understanding how Kingdom authority works is absolutely essential if you want to walk in the supernatural.\n2. Why authority and dominion matter in our prayer closets: It matters because God has given dominion over the earth to men. Therefore, if we want Him to move on the earth, we must ask. History is full of stories of God moving when there was prayer. If we want God to move, we must pray.\nPRAYER OPENS DOORS AND PROVIDES A WAY WHERE THERE SEEMS TO BE NO WAY\nFather is so serious about our prayer assignment that He actually gave us the Helper to help us pray! The Holy Spirit of grace and supplication has several specific jobs, but one of them is to move through us in prayer. Romans 8:26-27 says: \"Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the Saints according to the will of God.\"\nEven Jesus came as a baby in response to prayer and intercession. God had told us that it was His will to send the Messiah, and dedicated lovers of God prayed for the Deliverer to come for many years. We have dominion over the earth. If we desire to see God move on the earth, we must pray.\n3. God has always desired to converse and even reason with mankind. God desires the best for us now. Even if some things are stored up for the future, they can be pulled into the present by the prayer of faith.\nPULL ON GOD THROUGH FAITH-FILLED PRAYERS\nThen remember Moses, who interceded before God for the lives of the children of Israel. It was God's plan to wipe them out and raise up a new nation from the offspring of Moses. But Moses reasoned with God, and He changed His mind.\nGod's reasoning is the kind of reasoning that God encourages us to logically present His Word back to Him in prayer. Psalm 138:1-3, \"I will praise You with my whole heart; before the gods I will sing praises to You. I will worship toward Your holy temple, and praise Your name for Your loving-kindness and Your truth; for You have magnified Your Word above all Your name. In the day when I cried out, You answered me, and made me bold with strength in my soul.\"\nWhen we reason with God His way, we search out the deep things of His Word to discover His will for our lives individually and for the whole earth. Then, we go boldly before God's throne of grace as the kings over the earth that we are. From that position, we are to present our requests to Him with prayer, supplication, and thanksgiving\u2014based on His own Word. When we pray God's own Word back to Him, we have assurance that we will receive whatever we request.\n1 John 5:14-15 tells us this: \"Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him.\"\nSo doing business with God means presenting His own will back to Him. It's always His will to establish and expand His Kingdom of righteousness, peace, joy, and power on the earth and in your life personally. It's always His will for you to ask\u2014YES, FOR YOURSELF\u2014for Jesus said: \"Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full\" (John 16:24).\nQUESTIONS TO ASK MYSELF:\nHow will I respond?\nWill I set yourself apart to seek Him morning, noon, and night?\nWill I go boldly before His throne of grace, praying specific prayers and expecting specific answers?\nWill I accept the challenge to do business with God on purpose?\nALBERT FINCH MINISTRY", "id": "<urn:uuid:199f0174-c1ca-4a97-882a-4971232dd23f>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2017-34", "url": "http://afministry.ning.com/profiles/blogs/doing-business-with-god", "date": "2017-08-19T01:47:48Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2017-34/segments/1502886105291.88/warc/CC-MAIN-20170819012514-20170819032514-00680.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9618105292320251, "token_count": 1152}, "content": [{"line": "As Believers who are seeking to advance His Kingdom we have the right and privilege to do business with God.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Why does He need us to do business with Him?", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "1.

{"doc": {"text": "Hi there everyone! I have been less active lately on my blog and I\u2019m really sorry for that! I\u2019m currently working on getting a bunch of reviews up and ready to go, hopefully I\u2019ll get those finished! Even though school just started, I already have several things to complete, so I\u2019m kind of behind on things. Anyway, I\u2019m back with another tag for you guys: the TBR book tag, in which the lovely Josie from Josie\u2019s Book Corner has tagged me, (in the comments)! TBR means, in case you didn\u2019t know, \u2018to-be-read\u2019. My TBR is over the moon honestly, I have waaaay to many books that I have yet to read. So this tag is great! Anywho, let\u2019s get on with the tag!\nHow do you keep track of your TBR pile?\nGoodreads!!! I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without Goodreads. I have tons of books on my TBR and I usually just keep track of everything from there! However, there are times where I hear of a book, write it down somewhere, telling myself I\u2019ll add it to my Goodreads shelf, but end up forgetting to. This happens more times than I care to admit, (and as a result I\u2019m sure I have a lot of books on my TBR written on paper that I have yet to add to Goodreads) but for the most part Goodreads is my best friend when it comes to my TBR.\nIs your TBR mostly print or eBook?\nBoth, I think. In past years it probably would\u2019ve been ebook, but as I\u2019ve been increasing my physical book buying (wonderful for my shelves, terrible for my wallet) it\u2019s kind of evened out now and I have a lot of print and ebooks waiting to be read.\nHow do you determine which book from your TBR to read next?\nIt\u2019s a pretty spontaneous decision, really! Sometimes I choose books I have recently hauled, sometimes books that have been really hyped, and sometimes it\u2019s just really up to my mood! Feeling down about something? Cheesy contemporary it is! Wanting some action? A thriller or fantasy! You get the idea. If I have review copies I usually try to give those priority as well.\nA book that\u2019s been on your TBR list the longest?\nHuh. This is a hard one! I have no idea, but I would say Mansfield Park by Jane Austen. It\u2019s one of the only Jane Austen books I haven\u2019t read, and I have been meaning to for a while!\nA book you recently added to your TBR?\nWill you just look at this book! The Legend of Me by Rebekah L. Purdy is slated to be released on Februaray 2016, and I will surely be keeping my eye out for this one!\nA book on your TBR strictly because of it\u2019s beautiful cover?\nThe Last of the Firedrakes by Farah Oomerbhoy has such a beautiful cover! It looks so magical and has a very fairytail-istic look to it that I just love. I don\u2019t know much about the story, but this book is definitely on my TBR. (LOL quite superficial of me, but you can\u2019t just look at this cover and resist it! Not if you\u2019re like me, at least. <3)\nA book on your TBR that you never plan on reading?\nPossession by Elana Johnson seems like an interesting novel, but I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be reading this one! Mostly just due to time priorities, and just lack of interest compared to other books. There IS still a chance I will read this one day, but I have no plans of that in the near future. Though if you read and liked this book, maybe one of you guys will change my mind!\nAn unpublished book on your TBR that you\u2019re excited for?\nALL THE UNBUBLISHED BOOKSSSS. Kidding.\nNot really. There are so many awesome-seeming unpublished books that I am dying to have in my hands right now!\nWinter by Marissa Meyer, Six of Crows by Leigh Bardugo, The Winner\u2019s Kiss by Marie Rutkoski, Ten Thousand Skies Above You by Claudia Gray, First & Then by Emma Mills are just few of the books that I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on! I love how 4/5 of these are sci-fi, fantasy and all that, and I only have one book that is contemporary\u2026 there are a bunch more that I wish I could put in here, but if I do we\u2019ll be here until Christmas. \ud83d\ude09\nA book on your TBR that everyone has read but you?\nHonestly, I feel as if every single bookworm has read Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins. It\u2019s like some kind of unspoken rule or something! It\u2019s everywhere. Don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be getting around to this, but I will give it a try for sure.\nA book on your TBR that everyone recommends to you?\nMaybe not everyone because everyone hasn\u2019t read this book, but a lot of people has recommended The Young Elites by Marie Lu and I really want to read it! Especially since I\u2019ve also read and loved Marie Lu\u2019s Legend trilogy.\nA book on your TBR that you\u2019re dying to read?\nThe Queen of the Tearling by Erika Johansen seems soooo good and I honestly am dying to read it. And if I\u2019m not mistaken, this book is even slated for a movie (not much planned yet though) and Emma Watson has shown interest in it! Ahhhhhhh!!!! Although I haven\u2019t heard much on this news lately, you can check out this link for more details. Everyone and their mother has seemed to like this book, so I can\u2019t wait to read it sometime.\nHow many books are on your Goodreads TBR shelf?\nMore than I\u2019ll ever be able to read, I\u2019m sure, since I have 1095 books (last time I checked, at least) on my Goodreads TBR shelf!! I just never seem to be able to stop adding books to my TBR. Not to mention that this 1095 isn\u2019t even the whole thing; I have a bunch of other books I need to add to my Goodreads shelf that I haven\u2019t done yet. So, yes! Clearly I am unable to comprehend that I already have more books than I will ever need since I keep adding even more all the time. XD\nI know I tagged a lot of people in my Summer Reader Book Tag, so I will try to tag other people this time, but feel free to do this tag if you want to! I\u2019ll even add your name to the post if you want to do it\u2014just let me know in the comments below and consider it done! \u2764 This was a super fun tag so it would be great if you wanted to do it as well.\n- Aentee @ Read at Midnight\n- Alicia @ The Cyborg Knight\n- Alyssa @ Alyssa is Reading\n- Anette @ Anette Reads\n- Anne @ Anne-thology of Books\n- Arianna @ The Daydreaming Bookworm\n- Bhramori @ The Crazy Perfectionist\n- Bree @ The Literary Hellion\n- Charis @ Bookmarked Ponderings\n- Dee @ The Bookish Khaleesi\n- Jane @ Greenish Bookshelf\n- Kendra @ Reads and Treats\n- Nicolette @ A Little Bookish, A Little Writerly\n- Olivia @ Bibliomad\n- Qui @ Qui Reads\n- Samantha @ Bookish Library\n- Sara @ Freadom Library\n- Sumaya @ Sue\u2019s Reading Corner\n- Victoria @ Addlepates and Book Nerds\n- Yvo @ It\u2019s All About Books\n- Zezee @ Zezee with Books\nNo one is obligated to do this tag, but if you do, great! \u2764 Just link back so I can come check it out.\nWhat did you think of my choices?

{"doc": {"text": "Studies reveal that suicide claims more than 100 lives. Unfortunately, people are still uncomfortable talking about this issue, yet the news of people who have committed suicide continues to be read on the obituaries. However, the deaths of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain a few days apart have shed more light on this issue, and people are finally opening up to speak about it. In fact, research reveals that close to 45,000 Americans commit suicide every year, yet people are still treating the issue as a secret. The issue of suicide has been surrounded by misunderstanding and fear, which leads to lack of action.\nAccording to Patch, the worst bit about suicide is that the loved ones of the dead always feel guilty and ashamed because they feel that they could have done something different to prevent the death of their family member. Unfortunately, family and friends cannot know that something is wrong with you when you don\u2019t talk about it. Also, the other reason why suicide cases are on the rise is that people don\u2019t know how to react. Surprisingly, suicide also affects successful people. In fact, most suicidal people believe that nothing can be done to help them. However, the best way to end suicide cases is to open communication lines; hence, you should reach out to someone you think is struggling with depression.\nAra Chackerian is based in San Francisco. He is well-known as a philanthropist and an established entrepreneur. Ara spent most of his career life in the healthcare sector bridging the gap between health care services and technology. He also has an interest in youth development and environmental cases. Ara Chackerian recently spoke in an interview about his recent ventures where he revealed that he wanted to venture into TSM Health Solutions together with his longtime business partner. As a result, Ara spent close to a decade working on network centers in northern California. You can check out their Vimeo account for more videos.\nThe vision of TSM Health Solutions is to design a care delivery model that enabled patients and physicians to attain their desired goals. The methodology should be geared towards putting the interest of the patient first regarding treatment and experience. The new venture was formed about two years ago, and they have managed to build seven new facilities that serve Sacramento and San Francisco.\nFrom Humble beginnings, the founder of OSI Group, formerly doing business as Otto & Sons, started his butcher shop in 1909. Another new face came into the picture mid-century, someone with a small hamburger joint that he planned to franchise. The restaurant agreed to partner with Otto & Sons and receive their beef products exclusively from Otto. As the hamburger stand grew, the demand increased for the beef products from Otto & Sons. Together they made a fast food legend, known all over the world as McDonald\u2019s Hamburgers.\nBigger, Better, Bolder\nWith the early rapid expansion of McDonald\u2019s, the company needed to produce more and more beef patties. They accomplished this in the 70\u2019s by dedicating a state of the art facility solely for the products that were served in McDonald\u2019s restaurants. By this time, the company was transitioned into OSI Industries, and is now the Food Processing Giant OSI Group. The CEO has focused on expansion in the last few years. The demand for processed meat products on the global level has created an opportunity for OSI Group to expand into it\u2019s current 65 facilities across international borders. The headquarters are located in Illinois, but there are processing plants in 17 countries. With expansion came further opportunities, including the implementation of additional foods, such as the Riverside, CA plant produces. This plant processes salsa, tofu, and bean products. Additionally OSI Group has vegetable and frozen retail products.\nLeader In The Industry\nContinued growth has been a true American Dream story. From a German Immigrant named Otto Kolschowsky to one of the most prominent Food distributors in the world, the small family business became a leader in supplying major retailers with fresh processed foods. From poultry to fish, beef to bacon and everything in between the multi-billion dollar company has negotiated the acquisition of major food suppliers such as Tyson and Baho Foods. The expansion into Asia-Pacific regions, Australia, and South American countries in addition to many more, was a smart move for OSI, but two of the major contributors are Europe and China. The introduction into the WTO made China\u2019s ability to implement a facility in their country possible. Now OSI Group has additionally opened a dedicated R&D facility in Shanghai. The extreme growth in the 70\u2019s was a result of OSI\u2019s commitment to innovation, and it seems that the same is true today. With the CEO Sheldon Lavin\u2019s dedicated efforts in R&D, food safety, efficacy, and environmental impacts, the future of the company is definitely sound.\nPaul Mampilly is a holder of MBA from the University of Fordham.

{"doc": {"text": "The custom of honoring ancestors by cleaning cemeteries and decorating graves is an ancient and worldwide tradition, but the specific origin of Memorial Day, or Decoration Day as it was first known, are unclear. In early rural America, this duty was usually performed in late summer and was an occasion for family reunions and picnics. After the Civil War, America\u2019s need for a secular, patriotic ceremony to honor its military dead became prominent, as monuments to fallen soldiers were erected and dedicated, and ceremonies centering on the decoration of soldiers\u2019 graves were held in towns and cities throughout the nation.\nNo less than 25 places have been named in connection with the origin of Memorial Day, and for many years, states observed the holiday on different dates. By federal law, however, Memorial Day is now celebrated on the last Monday in May. Since it all started with the Civil War, you might want to brush up on your knowledge of this event by visiting the Library of Congress Civil War collection, which includes more than a thousand photographs.\nMy understanding is that there are a couple of words that were derived from sailing, one being \u201cposh\u201d and the other being \u201cnews.\u201d What are the true origins of these words, and is it true that they are derived from sail of old?\nThe origin of posh\u201d is obscure.The most seen explanation for the origin ascribes it to the days of the British Empire in the 19th (and early 20th) century when there was constant steamship travel between England and India. In those pre-air conditioning days, it was unbearably hot crossing the Indian Ocean, and the coolest cabins were the most sought after. That meant, when traveling east, those on the port side; sailing west, those on the starboard. Consequently, those passengers who could afford the luxury booked \u201cPort Outward/Starboard Homeward\u201d or \u201cP.O.S.H.\u201d The acronym thus became a synonym for whatever is first-class or luxurious. A more likely definition is that it is a word from Romany, the language of Gypsies, meaning half. The word originally entered England\u2019s underworld in the 17th century in such compounds as posh-houri, meaning half-pence, and soon became a slang term for money in general.

Meanwhile, General Electric is seeking approval to market a home refrigerator in the U.S. using a hydrocarbon refrigerant.\nThe new freezers take advantage of the way hydrocarbon gases absorb heat when they change from a liquid to a gas. It\u2019s the same process when a propane tank becomes cool to the touch when you\u2019re using it with a gas grill. The hydrocarbon refrigerant is compressed and expanded as it makes its way through the compressor and tubes surrounding the freezer.\nUnlike car exhaust or power plant pollution that\u2019s spewed directly into the air, the coolants used in most U.S. refrigerators today only enter the atmosphere when their compressors leak, or when appliances are thrown out and their refrigerant eventually escapes.\nIf hydrocarbons are accidentally released into the atmosphere, their effect on trapping heat is about 1,400 times less than conventional refrigerants, said Pete Gosselin, director of engineering for Ben & Jerry\u2019s.\nThe fuels are flammable, of course, but current models only use the amount contained in two or three cigarette lighters. Electronic components are designed to prevent igniting a possible leak.\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely potent,\u201d Gosselin said. \u201cAnd as the world develops, especially in developing nations, refrigeration use is one of the first technologies that comes on board.\u201d\nThe appliances cost about the same as similar conventional freezers and use about 10 percent less electricity.\n\u201cAnd that turns out to be a huge gain in terms of your carbon footprint, that 10 percent gain in efficiency,\u201d Gosselin said. \u201cEvery kilowatt hour that comes in the wall, comes in with a certain amount of CO2 footprint with it and if you can knock 10 percent off that, that\u2019s huge.\u201d\nThe U.S. will be playing catch-up.

{"doc": {"text": "MD and owner of Waterstone's bookshops\nSince the chill wind of recession swept through the world of publishing, an increasing number of launch parties that might formerly have been held in swanky, expensive venues have been taking place in rather more modest surroundings \u2013 often, in fact, in a branch of Daunt Books. Elegant, old-fashioned and crammed with lovely books and clever booksellers, these are bookshops as old-school book lovers would like to have them.

It feels really good to get this off my chest. At first, it was just a budget issue; I still feel the sticker shock from the first time I tried to put together one of those cute boards with five or six different wedges on them, plus the crackers, breads, pickles, dried fruit, toasted almonds, olives, cured meats, and all of the other minimum requirements of our latter-day horns of plenty.

Even though so much went unfinished, the leftovers were unsalvageable, as fingers, forks, knives, and crumbs got into everything (a particularly shuddering thought in the age of Covid). Instead, when people come over, or what I remember of it, I prefer to focus on one or two decadent, attention-grabbing things and nothing grabs attention on a cold winter day like warm, runny cheese.\nNEW: Watch me make this baked brie on YouTube!\nBaked brie was all the entertaining rage in the 1970s and 80s. Nothing was more glamorous but accessible, an imported cheese that everyone knew and could pronounce. But as Americans got more sophisticated about imported cheese \u2014 manchego!

First, I use my easy galette dough for a flaky pastry that tastes a million times better than most frozen puffed pastry and requires no extra grocery store trip.

A paper-thin slick of smooth Dijon mustard offsets the sweetness, a sprinkling of thyme gives it an herbal element, a scattering of sesame seeds on top adds a little extra crackle, or you can skip all three and it\u2019s still delicious. Brie \u2014 and yes, even commercial, grocery store brie works well here \u2014 is attainably-priced and even the basic stuff warms up beautifully, so no need to splurge here. Plus, it often comes in 8-ounce rounds, absolutely perfect for our tiny, at-home New Years celebrations this week to send 2020 packing.\nThe Year In Smitten Kitchen\nI love looking up which recipes you cooked the most each year, and could anything be more apt for 2020 than an Ultimate Banana Bread? In a year with so much none of us liked, a bright spot for me was the way the simplicity of our Covid pantries nudged me towards simpler, core recipes in previous years I foolishly dismissed as not interesting enough. You know what\u2019s interesting? Crispy crumbled potatoes, schmaltzy roast chicken, and what I hope will be the last classic vegetable lasagna you\u2019ll ever need. And speaking of pantries, I wrote about how I \u201corganize\u201d (spoiler: it\u2019s not) my SK pantry over here and while not a recipe, it was one of the most-read posts this year.

Once melted, cook the onions, stirring, until softened and beginning to lightly brown at the edges, about 5 minutes. Add sugar, salt, balsamic, and pepper and cook, stirring, until balsamic reduces to a dark, jammy puddle, about 3 to 5 more minutes. Transfer to a bowl to cool.\nTo assemble: Heat oven 400\u00b0F. Unwrap your chilled dough and reuse the parchment, if you can, to line a small baking sheet. Or, line one with a fresh sheet. Flour your counter and the top of the dough and roll into a large, thin circle, about 10 inches. Check for size by placing your brie in the middle and seeing if you have enough dough cover it across the top. No need to make a perfect circle.\nOnce dough is correct size, thinly spread first teaspoon of dijon in the middle, scatter half of your red onions over the dijon, and sprinkle them with half the thyme, if using. Place brie on top. Thinly spread remaining Dijon on top of brie, followed by remaining onions and thyme. Bring sides of dough up to wrap brie, making little folds to help it fit. Press edges together gently at the top.\nTransfer pastry-wrapped brie to baking sheet. Brush sides, pleats, and top of pastry with egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds, if using.\nBake: for 30 minutes, or until golden brown all over, rotating the tray if needed for even color. If you can bear it, let rest on a cooling rack for 10 minutes.\nServe: Transfer brie to a plate with a rim (it will be runny when you cut into it) and serve with crackers or baguette slices.", "id": "<urn:uuid:b8a04066-4027-4463-8a90-06bfe90702db>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2022-21", "url": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2020/12/baked-brie-with-balsamic-red-onions/?replytocom=1825917", "date": "2022-05-27T16:07:49Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2022-21/segments/1652662658761.95/warc/CC-MAIN-20220527142854-20220527172854-00200.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.8873404860496521, "token_count": 1741}, "content": [{"line": "Despite my deep affection for cheese, to the point that one of my favorite things to do on a New York City weekend is to dip into Murray\u2019s and treat us to something crumbly or aged or rich and runny, I don\u2019t love cheese plates.

{"doc": {"text": "In the beginning, God created humanity for relationship. He had angels to serve and worship Him, but He wanted something more, creatures whom He could enjoy spending time with, made in His image. (Genesis 1, 2) The foundation of this kind of love is freedom to choose. No love exists without this. And so God gave man the option to love Him or not. Ultimately, they chose to go their own way, the consequences being death. However, God had compassion and a plan. In the fullness of time, He sent Jesus, His son to the earth to live a sinless life and die in our place so we could live and have an opportunity to choose Him again. But it doesn\u2019t end there. Jesus rose from the grave in victory and power and offers that same power to you and me.\nOther religions require you to earn your way into God\u2019s graces. Christianity stands out in contrast because it\u2019s the only faith where God comes and becomes a man, chooses to take on the penalty for sin and to die. This is amazing love! Our part is to simply receive His gift of new life (salvation) and enter into relationship with Him! \u201cFor God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16\nThe first part is acknowledging that we\u2019ve sinned and gone our own way. Look at your past. Have you lived a perfect life? None of us have. \u201cAll have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.\u201d Romans 3:23 There\u2019s much we might regret or be ashamed of. The good news is that when we give our life to Jesus, He takes that sin, cleanses us and give us power to live a new life in Him. \u201cIf we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\u201d 1 John 1:9\nThe second part is receiving that new life and a new relationship with Him. Jesus offers radical transformation of your life, not just a patch-up job. He offers us His power, joy, healing and life.\nIf you\u2019ve never given your life to Jesus and would like to now, pray this prayer:\nJesus, I\u2019ve sinned and made a mess of my life. I want the freedom and cleansing that You offer. I thank You for loving me and dying for my sins. I receive Your forgiveness and the new life You have for me. Show me how to walk out this relationship with You. I want to know You more. Amen.\nCongratulations! You\u2019ve enter into a whole new life experience with Jesus! The meditations on this site will help you grow in developing a relationship with Him, but also encourage you to:\nIt\u2019s amazing that Jesus came to live among us, to experience humanity and to ultimately die for us and rise again. But that wasn\u2019t the end. Jesus said, \u201cIt is best for you that I go away, because if I don\u2019t, the Advocate (or Helper) won\u2019t come. If I do go away, then I will send Him to you.\u201d John 16:7. He told His disciples to wait in Jerusalem for the promise of the Holy Spirit and Acts 2:2-4 says \u201cAnd suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting\u2026and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit.\u201d\nThis experience is available to all who have accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior and who want to be empowered and gifted to walk the life God intended. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 6:19, \u201cDo you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God and you are not your own?\u201d\nHoly Spirit wants to fill you with power and gifts to live the abundant life God has for you. It\u2019s not something you have to work up or strive for, but simply a gift He wants to give you. To understand more fully the work and gifts of the Holy Spirit, read the book of Acts.\nIf you are ready to receive Holy Spirit in a deeper way, pray this prayer:\nFather, I thank you for sending Jesus to save me from my sins. Now I ask for the power of Holy Spirit to live the life You intended for me to live. Lord Jesus, baptize me in Your Holy Spirit. I receive Holy Spirit now by faith in Your Word. May the anointing, glory and power of God come on me right now and fill my life. I want to be empowered to partner with You to see Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Thank you Jesus for filling me with Holy Spirit now.\u201d Amen\nOur world is busy with lots of sounds. Its rare for us to just be quiet and still. It's not easy for us. Yet, it is in the quiet when we can best hear God's voice. Learning to meditate in silence is a valuable tool as well as a spiritual discipline. You may struggle with it in the beginning, but as you continue, you will find God filling the silence with His presence and love.\nWriting a Breath Prayer\nWriting a breath prayer is simply finding a sentence or phrase that fits the truth God is desire you to implant deeply in your heart. As often as possible, try to use Scripture as the basis for your prayer. You can use a concordance or an online resource like www.BlueLetterBible.org to look up a word or phrase to help you in this process. Here are some examples to help you get started:\nAnxious? Worried? Say silently \u201cThe Lord is my Shepherd\u201d as you breathe in picturing Jesus\u2019 tender care over you. Then as you breathe out, \u201cI shall not want\u201d (or \u201cI have all I need\u201d) as you release all your cares on Him. Repeat over and over until you feel fully at peace.\nStressed out? Overburdened? Say \u201cHis yoke is easy\u201d as you breathe in, choosing His easy yoke. \u201cHis burden is light\u201d as you breathe out, picturing Him remove your heavy burdens.\nFearful? Say \u201cThe Lord is for me\u201d as you breathe in picturing His loving protection over you. \u201cWhom (or what) shall I fear?\u201d as you breathe out, releasing all fear to Him.\nInsecure? Say \u201cI am my Beloved\u2019s\u201d as you breathe in experiencing His pleasure and delight over you. \u201cAnd He is mine\u201d as you breathe out, fully embraced by the King of Kings.\nWe encourage the phrases to be as close to Scripture, but yet easy to say in one breath. You might need to shorten or adapt to make it flow.

{"doc": {"text": "On Saturday morning, with absolutely no advance fanfare, or even explanation, Louis C.K. released Horace and Pete, a 67-minute filmed play with a cast that included himself, Steve Buscemi, Alan Alda, Edie Falco, and Jessica Lange. It was an achievement as impressive for the surprise of it, and the lack of detail, as for the quality of the performances by Alda and everyone else. C.K. didn\u2019t even offer a clue about when, or if, there might be more installments.\nThat changed today, when he sent out a message to fans on the LouisCK.net mailing list, which finally offered a bit of insight about the design behind the series and plans for its future.\nAbout the surprise release, for instance, he explained, \u201cAs a TV watcher I\u201dm always delighted when I can see a thing without knowing anything about it because of the promotion. So making this show and just posting it out of the blue gave me the rare opportunity to give you that experience of discovery.\u201d\nHe also noted that the filming style allows the episodes to be produced very close to when they\u2019re released (the next one, which he\u2019s shooting now, will be available on Saturday), but spent most of his time responding to the same question I saw a lot of in the comments: why did this cost $5, when most TV episodes cost much less to download?\nHere\u2019s the bulk of his explanation:\nOkay so let\u201ds talk for a minute about the five dollars of it all. If you\u201dre on this email list then you\u201dre probably aware that I always make an effort to make the work I do on my own as cheap as possible and as painless as possible to get. That\u201ds why my specials are five dollars and that\u201ds why I sold tickets to my last big tour here on the site, with our own ticketing service at a flat price with no ticket charges and we have worked hard to keep my tickets out of the hands of scalpers.\nSo why the dirty fuckballs did I charge you five dollars for Horace and Pete, where most TV shows you buy online are 3 dollars or less? Well, the dirty unmovable fact is that this show is fucking expensive.\nThe standup specials are much more containable. It\u201ds one guy on a stage in a theater and in most cases, the cost of the tickets that the live audience paid, was enough to finance the filming.\nBut Horace and Pete is a full on TV production with four broadcast cameras, two beautiful sets and a state of the art control room and a very talented and skilled crew and a hall-of-fame cast. Every second the cameras are rolling, money is shooting out of my asshole like your mother\u201ds worst diarrhea. (Yes there are less upsetting metaphors I could be using but I just think that one is the sharpest and most concise). Basically this is a hand-made, one guy paid for it version of a thing that is usually made by a giant corporation.\nNow, I\u201dm not complaining about this at all. I\u201dm just telling you the facts. I charged five dollars because I need to recoup some of the cost in order for us to stay in production.\nAlso, it\u201ds interesting. The value of any set amount of money is mercurial (I\u201dm showing off because i just learned that word. It means it changes and shifts a lot). Some people say \u201cFive dollars is a cup of coffee\u201d. Some people say \u201cHey! Five dollars?? What the fuck!\u201d Some people say \u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201d Some people say \u201cNothing. don\u201dt enter a conversation in the middle\u201d.\nAnyway, I\u201dm leaving the first episode at 5 dollars. I\u2019m lowering the next episode to 2 dollars and the rest will be 3 dollars after that. I hope you feel that\u201ds fair. If you don\u201dt, please tell everyone in the world.\nAnd that\u2019s that. We know that a new episode is coming on Saturday, and more down the road, but we don\u2019t know how much. C.K. promised to tell us more eventually, \u201cBut for now I want to shut up and not ruin the experience of you just watching the show.\u201d", "id": "<urn:uuid:caf1ba26-d339-45ae-96f3-94d980666427>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2020-45", "url": "https://uproxx.com/sepinwall/louis-ck-explains-horace-and-pete-secrecy-plus-that-5episode-price/", "date": "2020-10-21T02:43:13Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2020-45/segments/1603107874637.23/warc/CC-MAIN-20201021010156-20201021040156-00360.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9641146063804626, "token_count": 934}, "content": [{"line": "On Saturday morning, with absolutely no advance fanfare, or even explanation, Louis C.K. released Horace and Pete, a 67-minute filmed play with a cast that included himself, Steve Buscemi, Alan Alda, Edie Falco, and Jessica Lange.

{"doc": {"text": "Table of Contents:\n- Symptoms of MS\n- What Is Multiple Sclerosis?\n- Multiple Sclerosis Treatment\n- Early Signs of MS\nPart 1 of 11\nWhat are the symptoms of MS?\nPeople with MS experience a wide range of symptoms. Due to the nature of the disease, it can vary widely from one person to another. The symptoms can change in severity from year to year, month to month, and even day to day.\nTwo of the most common symptoms are fatigue and difficulty walking.\nAbout 80 percent of people with MS report having fatigue. Fatigue that occurs with MS is more than feeling tired. It can become debilitating, affecting your ability to work and perform everyday tasks.\nDifficulty walking can occur with MS for a number of reasons:\n- numbness of the legs or feet\n- difficulty balancing\n- muscle weakness\n- muscle spasticity\nOverwhelming fatigue can also contribute to the problem. Difficulty walking can lead to injuries due to falling.\nOther fairly common symptoms of MS include:\n- speech disorders\n- cognitive issues involving concentration, memory, and problem-solving skills\n- acute or chronic pain\nPart 2 of 11\nWhat is multiple sclerosis?\nMS is a chronic illness involving the central nervous system. The immune system attacks myelin, which is the protective layer around nerve fibers. This causes inflammation and scar tissue, or lesions. This can make it hard for your brain to send signals to the rest of your body. Types of MS include:\nRelapsing-remitting MS (RRMS)\nRRMS involves clear relapses of disease activity followed by remissions. Symptoms are mild or absent during remission, and there\u2019s no disease progression during the remission period. RRMS is the most common form of MS at onset.\nClinically isolated syndrome (CIS)\nCIS involves one episode of symptoms that are due to demyelination in the central nervous system. This episode must last for at least 24 hours.\nThe two types of episodes are monofocal and multifocal. A monofocal episode means one lesion causes one symptom. A multifocal episode means you have more than one lesion and more than one symptom.\nAlthough these episodes are characteristic of MS, they aren\u2019t enough to prompt a diagnosis. If lesions similar to those that occur with MS are present, you\u2019re more likely to receive a diagnosis of RRMS. If these lesions aren\u2019t present, you\u2019re less likely to develop MS.\nPrimary-progressive MS (PPMS)\nNeurological function becomes progressively worse from the onset of your symptoms if you have PPMS. However, short periods of stability can still occur.\nProgressive-relapsing MS was a term people previously used for progressive MS with clear relapses. People now call it PPMS. The words \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cnot active\u201d are used to describe disease activity.\nSecondary-progressive MS (SPMS)\nSPMS occurs when RRMS transitions into the progressive form. You may still have noticeable relapses, in addition to gradual worsening of function or disability.\nPart 3 of 11\nTreatment for multiple sclerosis\nNo cure is available for MS, but multiple treatment options exist.\nIf you have relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), you can choose one of the disease-modifying drugs. These medications are designed to slow disease progression and lower your relapse rate.\nSelf-injectable disease-modifying drugs include glatiramer (Copaxone, Glatopa) and beta interferons, such as:\nOral medications for RRMS include:\nIntravenous infusion treatments for RRMS include:\nDisease-modifying drugs aren\u2019t effective in treating progressive MS.\nOther treatments may ease your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Because the disease is different for everybody, treatment depends on your specific symptoms. For most people, a flexible approach is necessary.\nPart 4 of 11\nEarly signs of MS\nMS can develop all at once, or the symptoms can be so mild that you easily dismiss them. Any symptom can occur first. The following are three of the most common early symptoms of MS:\n- Strange sensations, such as numbness and tingling of the arms, legs, or one side of your face can occur. It\u2019s similar to that of feeling of pins and needles you get when your foot falls asleep, but it occurs for no apparent reason.\n- Your balance may be a bit off, and your legs may feel week. You may find yourself tripping easily while walking or doing some other type of physical activity.\n- A bout of double vision, blurry vision, or partial vision loss can be an early indicator of MS. You could also have some eye pain.\nIt isn\u2019t uncommon for these early symptoms to go away only to return at a later date. You may go weeks, months, or even years between symptom flare-ups.\nThese symptoms can have many different causes. If you have these symptoms, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you have MS.\nPart 5 of 11\nYour doctor will need to perform a neurological exam, a clinical history, and a series of other tests to determine if you have MS.\nDiagnostic testing may include the following:\n- MRI is the best imaging test for MS. Using a contrast dye allows the MRI to detect active and inactive lesions throughout the brain and spinal cord.\n- Evoked potentials require stimulation of nerve pathways to analyze electrical activity in the brain. The three types of evoked potentials doctors use to help diagnose MS are visual, brainstem, and sensory.\n- A spinal tap, or lumbar puncture, can help your doctor find abnormalities in your spinal fluid. It can help rule out infectious diseases.\n- Doctors use blood tests to eliminate other conditions with similar symptoms.\nThe diagnosis of MS requires evidence of demyelination in more than one area of the brain, spinal cord, or optic nerves. That damage must have occurred at different times.\nIt also requires ruling out other conditions that have similar symptoms. This includes Lyme disease, lupus, and Sjogren's syndrome.\nPart 6 of 11\nWhat causes multiple sclerosis?\nIf you have MS, the myelin in your body becomes damaged. Myelin is the protective layer that covers nerve fibers throughout the central nervous system.\nIt\u2019s thought that the damage is the result of an attack by the immune system. As your immune system attacks myelin, it causes inflammation. This leads to scar tissue, or lesions. All of that inflammation and scar tissue disrupts signals between the brain and other parts of your body.\nIt isn\u2019t clear what may cause the immune system to attack.\nIs MS hereditary?\nMS isn\u2019t hereditary, but having a parent or sibling with MS raises your risk slightly. Genetics may play a role. Scientists have identified some genes that seem to increase susceptibility to developing MS.\nResearchers think there could be an environmental trigger such as a virus or toxin that sets off the immune system attack.\nPart 7 of 11\nWhat is the prognosis for people with multiple sclerosis?\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to predict how MS will progress in any one person.\nAbout 10 to 15 percent of people with MS have only rare attacks and minimal disability ten years after diagnosis. It\u2019s not a medical diagnosis, but this is sometimes called \u201cbenign MS.\u201d\nProgressive MS generally advances faster than relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). People with RRMS can be in remission for many years. A lack of disability after five years is usually a good indicator for the future.\nThe disease generally progresses faster in men than in women. It may also progress faster in those who receive a diagnosis after age 40 and in those who have a high relapse rate.\nAbout half of people with MS use a cane or other form of assistance at 15 years after receiving an MS diagnosis. At 20 years, about 60 percent are still ambulatory and less than 15 percent need custodial care.\nYour quality of life will depend on your symptoms and how well you respond to treatment. Most people with MS don\u2019t become severely disabled and continue to lead full lives.\nThis unpredictable disease can change course without warning. It\u2019s rarely fatal, and most people with MS have a lifespan that\u2019s close to normal.\nPart 8 of 11\nLiving with MS\nMost people with MS find ways to manage their symptoms and function well. You\u2019ll face unique challenges, and those can change over time. Many people with MS share their struggles and coping strategies through in-person or online support groups.\nHaving MS means you\u2019ll need to see a doctor experienced in treating MS.\nIf you take one of the disease-modifying drugs, you\u2019ll have to make sure you adhere to the recommended schedule. Your doctor may prescribe other medications to treat specific symptoms.\nA well-balanced diet, low in empty calories and high in nutrients and fiber, will help you manage your overall health.\nRegular exercise is important for physical and mental health, even if you have disabilities. If physical movement is difficult, swimming or exercising in a swimming pool can help. Yoga classes range from beginner to advanced levels, and some are designed just for people with MS.\nStudies regarding the effectiveness of complementary therapies are scarce, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t help in some way.\nThe following may help you feel less stressed and more relaxed:\n- tai chi\n- music therapy\nMS is a lifelong condition. You should focus on communicating concerns with your doctor, learning all you can about MS, and discovering what things make you feel your best.\nPart 9 of 11\nDietary recommendations for people with MS\nDiet hasn\u2019t been shown to impact the nature of the disease, but it can help with some of the challenges. If you have fatigue, for instance, a diet high in fats and simple carbohydrates won\u2019t help.\nThe better your diet, the better your overall health. You\u2019ll not only feel better in the short term, but you\u2019ll be laying the foundation for a healthier future.\nYour diet should consist mainly of:\n- a variety of vegetables and fruits\n- lean sources of protein, such as fish and skinless poultry\n- whole grains and other sources of fiber\n- low-fat dairy products\n- adequate water and other fluids\nYou should limit or avoid:\n- saturated fat\n- trans fat\n- red meats\n- foods and beverages high in sugar\n- foods high in sodium\n- highly processed foods\nPortion control can help you maintain a healthier weight. Read food labels. Foods that are high in calories but low in nutrients won\u2019t help you feel better.\nIf you have coexisting conditions, ask your doctor if you should follow a special diet or take any dietary supplements.\nPart 10 of 11\nStatistics about MS\nMS is the most widespread neurological condition disabling young adults worldwide.\nAbout 400,000 people in the United States have MS, though that\u2019s only an estimate. Doctors in the United States aren\u2019t required to report MS to any agency. According to the National MS Society, there hasn\u2019t been a scientifically sound, national study on the prevalence of MS in the United States since 1975.\nMost people are between the ages of 20 and 40 when their doctor diagnoses them with MS. Women develop MS 2 to 3 times more often than men, a difference that has grown steadily for five decades. MS is more common among Caucasians of northern European ancestry than other ethnic groups.\nRates of MS tend to be lower in places that are closer to the equator. The rates of MS are higher in places farther away from the equator. This may have to do with sunlight and vitamin D. People who relocate to a new location before age 15 generally acquire the risk factors associated with the new location.\nPart 11 of 11\nWhat are the effects of MS?\nThe lesions from MS can appear anywhere in the central nervous system. This means they can affect any part of your body.\nOne of the most common symptoms of MS is fatigue, but it\u2019s not uncommon for people with MS to also have:\n- some degree of cognitive impairment\nAs you age, some disabilities from MS may become more pronounced. If you have mobility issues, you may be at an increased risk for bone fractures and breaks due to falls. Mobility issues can also lead to a lack of physical activity, which can lead to other health problems. Fatigue and mobility issues may also have an impact on sexual function. Having other conditions such as arthritis and osteoporosis can complicate matters.\n- About multiple sclerosis. (n.d.).

{"doc": {"text": "Risk management relies on statistical metrics that converge on common standards. These metrics can change drastically alongside market conditions. A risk management shock is a large unanticipated market-wide change in statistical risk estimates. These shocks give rise to coerced or even distressed flows, typically subsequent to an initial large move in market prices. Risk management shocks and related flows can team up with other dynamics in the financial system to form feedback loops. Such reinforcing dynamics include dynamic hedging, market price-driven credit downgrades, popular fear of crisis, investment fund redemptions, and forced deleveraging. Feedback loops can trigger large and persistent price distortions and offer special trading opportunities.\nThe below is the third instalment of this site\u2019s updated summary of key forces behind market price distortions, i.e. deviations of quoted prices from a level that would clear the market if all participants were trading for conventional risk-return optimization. Previous posts explained price distortions that arise from liquidity conditions and rebalancing rules.\nRisk management shocks\nThe risk management rules of most institutional investors follow commonly accepted standards. Alas, similar rules often coerce similar flows. And one-sided flows in markets with limited liquidity can push prices far from fundamental values. In this way, conventional risk management rules can be a cause of distortions and even set in motion self-reinforcing feedback loops.\nProminent risk metrics are value-at-risk (VaR), a statistical measure of expected maximum loss at a specific horizon within a specific range of probability, and expected shortfall, a measure of expected drawdown in a distress case. These statistical assessments of risk rely on historical variances and covariances, and can be subject to sudden major revisions.\n- The calculation of risk metrics depends on the lookback window, i.e. the history of the price return experiences used for its calculation and the weighting of recent versus distant observations. Lookback windows that rely on multi-year experience adapt poorly to a changing risk environment. Therefore, many risk metrics are short, with a half-time of lookbacks of no more than 11 days. This makes them susceptible to drastic reassessments based on market volatility alone. Such \u201cstatistical\u201d reassessment would occur without any consideration of the underlying causes of changes in volatility.\n- Even with many years of data history, risk estimates are still vulnerable to event shocks. Small variations in assumptions can cause large changes in forecasts. Some research claims that it would take half a century of daily price data for VaR and expected shortfall models to reach their theoretical asymptotic properties. Intuitively, even long historical samples have only limited data on actual crises and hence are subject to revision with each new crisis experiences (view post here).\n- Risk models are prone to compounding uncertainty when they matter most: in financial crises. Research shows that different types of statistical risk models tend to diverge during market turmoil and hence become themselves a source of fears and confusion (view post here). Acceptable performance and convergence of risk models in normal times can lull the financial system into a false sense of reliability\nReliance on statistical metrics can give rise to so-called \u2018VaR shocks\u2019: If estimated risk metrics surge, VaR-sensitive institutions recalibrate the risk of their existing positions and subsequently reduce their positions (view post here). For example, if an institution has a fixed \u201cstatistical\u201d risk budget a doubling of the estimated value-at-risk or expected shortfall requires it to liquidate half of its nominal positions. Importantly, this type of selling pressure typically arises after the initial price decline.\nAnalogously, many trading desks or asset management companies set \u201cdrawdown limits\u201d for their managers. These are loss thresholds for a portfolio\u2019s net asset value beyond which traders must liquidate part of all of their positions. Managers are typically under obligation to cut risk regardless of asset value and return prospects. Hence, once the common drawdown limits are broken additional flows ensue in the same direction of the original loss, accentuating price movements for no fundamental reason.\nInitial shocks to risk metrics and related flows can team up with other forces to form feedback loops:\n- Dynamic hedging: Many institutions run explicit or implicit \u201cshort volatility\u201d positions. Indeed, such short-volatility strategies seem to have expanded strongly in the wake of declining fixed-income yields. They pay steady positive risk premia in normal times, just like a fixed income asset, but at the peril occasional outsized losses. Dynamic hedging refers to sales and purchases of underlying assets in order to contain the risk related to volatility. This gives rise to feedback loops in two ways.\n- From a macro perspective, there is reinforcement between volatility and the scale of short-volatility strategies (view post here). In particular, there is a plausible feedback loop between low interest rates, debt expansion, (low) asset volatility, and financial engineering that allocates risk based on that volatility.\n- From a micro or trading perspective, dynamic hedging is common practice for option books but is applied widely in other markets, including credit, rates and leveraged risk parity. For example, U.S. financial institutions have historically been \u201cshort volatility\u201d with respect to long-term interest rates because of homeowners\u2019 option to repay mortgages early (view post here). In times of declining yields delta and probability of execution of this implied option is increasing, forcing institutions to hedge by further extending duration exposure. The probability of severe \u201cconvexity events\u201d has been reduced since the Federal Reserve has bought a sizable share of mortgage-backed securities from the market (view post here), but not eliminated.\n- Credit risk: Risk management can also form feedback loops with credit risk, particularly country risk and counterparty risk. A good illustration for this is the Credit Default Swaps (CDS) market. CDS are assumed to represent a measure of default risk. In practice, this (less liquid) market can gap in large moves, simply as a consequence of one-sided institutional order flows, which themselves could be motivated by risk management or regulatory considerations (view post here). As CDS spreads themselves are used as a measure of credit risk, institutional flows and spreads can reinforce each other to form escalatory dynamics.\n- Public fear: Financial market turbulences typically focus popular attention on crisis risk. Bouts of fear of extreme events, such as economic depressions or war, are more frequent than the actual occurrence of disasters (view post here). In normal or good times, people tend to pay little attention to extremes. As economic or political conditions deteriorate, people begin to contemplate the possibility and consequences of disasters. Such enhanced awareness plausibly changes subjective expectations and price of risk. This is called \u201csalience theory\u201d(view post here). If public fear of crisis is rising, financial risk managers experience pressure from investors, shareholders and even governments to position more defensively.\n- Redemptions: Significant declines in the net asset values of investment vehicles usually give rise to redemptions, often from investors that cannot afford or bear watching wealth dwindling beyond certain thresholds. This is supported theoretically and empirically for equity, bond and credit markets (view post here). In many cases, funds provide daily liquidity and costs of redemptions are effectively borne by investors that do not redeem or redeem late. This creates incentives for fire sales and causes price distortions (view post here). Indeed, the pro-cyclicality of redemptions is consistent with survey evidence of pro-cyclicality of equity return expectations of investors (view post here).\n- Forced deleveraging: Risk-reduction in banks and other financial intermediaries does not only constrain their own asset holdings but, indirectly, those of other market participants, particularly leveraged investors such as hedge funds. This creates both relative price distortions and high directional risk premia. Most obviously, limitations of arbitrage capital give rise to price differentials between contracts with similar risk profiles (view post here). Also, empirical analyses have found that the leverage provided by Broker-Dealers, i.e. their funding of others, is an important explanatory variable for the risk premium paid on equity and credit exposure (view post here). When credit supply is ample, risk premia and future excess returns are low. When credit supply is scarce, risk premia and future excess returns are high.", "id": "<urn:uuid:586fe5fa-fea0-4675-8a54-ad92e0fe558e>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2020-45", "url": "http://www.sr-sv.com/risk-management-shocks-and-price-distortions/", "date": "2020-10-30T10:21:58Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2020-45/segments/1603107910204.90/warc/CC-MAIN-20201030093118-20201030123118-00080.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9290454387664795, "token_count": 1718}, "content": [{"line": "Risk management relies on statistical metrics that converge on common standards.

Mica, R-FL, and 39 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R 2018 because it would significantly undermine the Clean Water Act (CWA) and could adversely affect public health, the economy, and the environment.\nUnder the CWA, one of the Nation\u2019s most successful and effective environmental laws, the Federal Government acts to ensure safe levels of water quality across the country through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Since the enactment of the CWA in 1972, the Federal Government has protected the waterways our citizens depend on by using its checks and balances authority to review and adjust key State water pollution control decisions, where necessary, to assure that they reflect up to date science, comply with the law, and protect downstream water users in other States. H.R. 2018 would roll back the key provisions of the CWA that have been the underpinning of 40 years of progress in making the Nation\u2019s waters fishable, swimmable, and drinkable.\nH.R. 2018 could limit efforts to safeguard communities by removing the Federal Government\u2019s authority to take action when State water quality standards are not protective of public health. In addition, it would restrict EPA\u2019s authority to take action when it finds that a State\u2019s CWA permit or permit program is inadequate and would shorten EPA\u2019s review and collaboration with the Army Corps of Engineers on permits for dredged or fill material. All of these changes could result in adverse impacts to human health, the economy, and the environment through increased pollution and degradation of water bodies that serve as venues for recreation and tourism, and that provide drinking water sources and habitat for fish and wildlife.\nH.R. 2018 would disrupt the carefully constructed complementary CWA roles for EPA, the Army Corps of Engineers, and States in protecting water quality. It also could eliminate EPA\u2019s ability to protect water quality and public health in downstream States from actions in upstream States, and could increase the number of lawsuits challenging State permits. In sum, H.R. 2018 would upset the CWA\u2019s balanced approach to improve water quality across the Nation, risking the public health and economic benefits of cleaner waters.\nIf the President is presented with this legislation, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n* * * * * * *\nAssociate Director for Policy Outreach\nWhite House Council on Environmental Quality", "id": "<urn:uuid:e682c85c-9c07-4ba1-800d-5656973c50ae>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2016-30", "url": "http://appvoices.org/2011/07/12/expect-the-president-to-veto-h-r-2018-clean-water-cooperative-federalism-act/", "date": "2016-07-31T09:20:25Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-30/segments/1469257828314.45/warc/CC-MAIN-20160723071028-00091-ip-10-185-27-174.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9402017593383789, "token_count": 553}, "content": [{"line": "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "July 12, 2011", "label": "date without context", "split": false}, {"line": "STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "H.R. 2018 \u2013 Clean Water Cooperative Federalism Act", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "(Rep.

The Austrian-born photographer is a true vagabond and has collected many stories along the way in her young 23 years. She sits down with us to tell us about her personal happy place and traditions for the holidays.\nTheresa, where is your personal happy place?\nTo be honest, nothing makes me happier than standing atop a mountain and soaking up the nature I\u2019m surrounded by. I think it\u2019s the Austrian in me. My road trip through Scotland was one of the greatest trips I\u2019ve ever taken.\nDo you have a special Christmas tradition?\nI\u2019m pretty old fashioned. I have to spend Christmas with my family \u2013 preferably in the mountains! A white Christmas is a must for me. We attend church together, like we did when I was a child. And we always eat this special noodle soup with sausage \u2013 a real Austrian specialty. It wouldn\u2019t be Christmas without it!\nFor some, it\u2019s a special hot beverage, for some a certain song. What puts you in the mood for Christmas?\nThis year, I think it will be the time I take for myself during the holidays. Especially now, considering I\u2019m constantly on the go. I haven\u2019t planned anything for Christmas and am looking forward to doing nothing! I\u2019m going to my family in Austria and will just spend some quality time with them. That\u2019s the greatest thing in the world for me.\nDo you celebrate Christmas in the same place every year?\nYes. I spent Christmas without my family once while I was living in New York. It was definitely an unforgettable holiday, but my mum wasn\u2019t very happy about it!\nIs there someplace that you would like to celebrate Christmas if you could?\nSnow is a must. I don\u2019t think I would enjoy Christmas in a place like Miami, chilling on the beach. Maybe an isolated cabin on a snowcapped mountain in the middle of nature \u2013 that would be my happy place! It doesn\u2019t really matter if the cabin is in Austria or Canada \u2013 as long as there's snow and I can spend time with the people who are most important to me.", "id": "<urn:uuid:43408fe5-450b-4215-8a57-c612c2167e89>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2019-35", "url": "https://horizn-studios.co.uk/en/journal/friends/interview-with-theresakaindl/", "date": "2019-08-25T19:40:32Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-35/segments/1566027330786.8/warc/CC-MAIN-20190825173827-20190825195827-00480.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9601991772651672, "token_count": 556}, "content": [{"line": "Life Of A Vagabond", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Theresa Kaindl on her seasonal Happy Place", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Twelve flights, two continents, four languages: Berlin, Milan, Paris, New York, Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck and a roadtrip through Scotland \u2013 all in just a month.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Freelance photographer Theresa Kaindl (see her Instagram here) used to live in New York, serving clients ranging from Montblanc to Puma and Corona, and moved to Berlin in September.

Anything that involves force pushes involves changing history, although I agree that squashing has less of an impact. ^Sytse\nThe question in my mind is: who would be the author of the new commit if the merge request has multiple authors. `merge --squash` just creates a new commit under the current author by default. We can of course make Gitlab chose an author smartly, maybe just chose the one who made the most commits, and if draw take the one who made the earliest commit.\n@Fabio: I believe they are not the same: rabase changes history, and this does not: it creates a single commit on top of the target that is the squash of all new commits.\nFabio Sobral commented\nAs noted by Maxime, this is similar to http://feedback.gitlab.com/forums/176466-general/suggestions/4289653-rebase-merge-requests-in-the-web-ui.\nNot exactly the same thing, but kind of different ways to implement the same workflow.\nMaybe consider merging both suggestions? IDK how this works.\nSam Gleske commented\nThis would be more useful if GitLab tracked in a single merge-request multiple force push revisions. That is to say if the state of the MR has been changed you should be able to see the old state and the current state as well as N number of changed states.

After the code review is complete, you can squash + force push.\nGerard Stannard commented\nHaving to squash locally at the command line means we don't push small commits for immediate code review feedback. Once the commit has been pushed, the oppoortunity for squashing has been lost, so developers tend not to commit until they're ready to squash many small commits.\nJody Mulkey commented\nCurrently, merging using the GitLab UI results in all commits within the source branch being inserted into the history of the target branch. For a large feature or fix with lots of commits, this clutters the target branch with potentially extraneous commits. This clutter can make it difficult to cherry-pick features/bug fixes into and out of other branches (for releases, for example), and build clean release notes.\nThis can be worked around by doing manual command-line steps to merge the source into the target. It would be extremely convenient, however, to do this from the GitLab UI.\nErik Donohoo commented\nI can't stress how important this is. It would be magnificent to have this.\nRyan Shelley commented\nThis would be extremely useful as part of our GitFlow process to be able to create releases of individual features.

{"doc": {"text": "View Article in PDF\nTHE term \u201chacker\u201d typically conjures up images of computer-savvy villains devilishly clicking and typing their way into unsuspecting victims\u2019 computer systems. Within the software development community, however, hacking has a more positive purpose. \u201cTo hack\u201d is to innovate, test, and experiment with computer code to create new, purposeful software for various applications.\nLivermore has taken a page from the software industry\u2019s playbook, conducting special events during which computer scientists throughout the Laboratory have 24 hours in which to brainstorm, develop, and improve software products. This friendly competition, known as ShipIt days, provides an outlet for developers to explore different software languages and to collaborate with others in their field. \u201cDuring ShipIt, employees have autonomy to work on software-related products that they find interesting without the added pressure of having to make the project succeed,\u201d says Kyle Dickerson, a Livermore software engineer and ShipIt participant. \u201cThe opportunity to be creative with few restrictions helps boost employee morale, motivation, and ingenuity.\u201d By providing a break from regular work activities, the events help employees reinvigorate their software-developing psyche.\nShipIt projects focus on either advancing a Laboratory mission or developing a relevant skill, and employees are free to evaluate a wide range of products that may or may not have immediate applicability to their work activities. \u201cShipIt events provide a venue for rapid code development,\u201d says Katherine Lewis, a Livermore computer scientist and one of the event organizers. \u201cThey are a time for employees to indulge in inklings or interests that could potentially lead to programmatic applications.\u201d\nThe ShipIt day name and format are derived from a similar program created by Atlassian, an Australian-based software development company. Two weeks before an event, organizers and participants meet to discuss the day\u2019s schedule, suggest project ideas, form teams, and outline project goals. The actual event occurs over a 24-hour period, but teams are not required to participate the entire time. Toward the end of the day, teams present their results to fellow participants. Xinh Huynh, a former Livermore computer scientist and past event organizer, says, \u201cIt\u2019s a little like being on \u2018American Idol.\u2019 After the final presentations, the audience votes for the best project. The judges are people we consider Computation \u2018celebrities\u2019\u2014division leaders and other high-level managers.\u201d\nNearly 80 Computation employees took part in the first three ShipIt days, working in their offices, conference rooms, or the High-Performance Computing Innovation Center (see S&TR, September 2012, Venturing into the Heart of High-Performance Computing Simulations), which is part of the Livermore Valley Open Campus. Events for Global Security and for Livermore Computing (LC) in the Computation Directorate were held August 24\u201325, 2012, with the competition beginning at noon one day and ending at noon the next. Computation\u2019s Applications, Simulations, and Quality Division held the third event on February 28 and March 1, 2013.\nFuture ShipIt days will be interdepartmental, encouraging an even broader range of ideas. Outstanding projects from the first competitions include a mobile Android application for counterproliferation efforts; a portlet for viewing computer simulation results via a Web browser; and a widget for LabBook, the Laboratory\u2019s internal social network.\nSoftware engineers in Global Security are devising applications to navigate and analyze the massive amounts of data acquired in support of counterproliferation efforts. One such application is Element Centric (EleCent), a component in the Laboratory\u2019s Counterproliferation Analysis and Planning System. (See S&TR, December 2011, Data for Defense: New Software Finds It Fast.) EleCent allows users to store, update, retrieve, and analyze critical data, including the location and type of hazardous materials housed at facilities worldwide. It combines an enormous database with Web-based tools for viewing results in various formats, from tabular lists to geospatial maps. A Google Earth plug-in summarizes data in a geospatial display.\nDickerson and two colleagues used ShipIt time to develop an app that displays EleCent data on an Android device, such as a tablet or phone. \u201cThe GPS component of mobile systems makes an EleCent app appealing,\u201d says Dickerson. \u201cIt would allow users to get information specific to their exact location, such as what facilities and materials are nearby that they need to be aware of.\u201d He adds that this type of tool has potential for defense applications and for humanitarian efforts. \u201cSomeone working in an active emergency response zone, for example, would be able to identify the locations of facilities in the area and the types of hazards they present.\u201d\nFor ShipIt, team members configured their desktop computers to run Google\u2019s software development kit for Android apps and divided project tasks among members. \u201cPrior to the event, we were not allowed to write any code,\u201d says Dickerson. Over the next several hours, they overcame coding, database, and interface issues to deliver a simple working prototype for their final presentation. \u201cWe created a working model that retrieves actual data and displays the results on a mobile device.\u201d\nMore extensive work would be needed before the tool could be deployed for defense applications, but the EleCent mobile app prototype shows what is possible. \u201cWe\u2019ve demonstrated that the technology fits nicely into our programmatic work,\u201d says Dickerson. \u201cIt offers real potential for our customers.\u201d\nProject teams are much freer to experiment when they are less concerned about an idea failing. A project by Global Security software engineers Tim Bender and Josh Oakgrove demonstrates how a ShipIt team can change direction and still yield fruitful results. \u201cWe started working on a neural network framework for Java that could be used for space situational awareness,\u201d says Bender. (See S&TR, July/August 2009, Preventing Close Encounters of the Orbiting Kind.) \u201cThe framework would help users determine the difference between the estimated and actual elliptical drift of an object around Earth.\u201d\nAfter finding open-source software for the application, the engineers hacked on that code for several hours until they realized they did not have enough time to produce results with their data set. At midnight, they abandoned their initial idea and started a completely different project: developing a Klout score component to LabBook. With only 12 hours remaining for ShipIt, they decided the Klout score project had a better chance of success in such a short time.\nKlout scores measure user engagement and activity on social networking sites based on several factors, including number of subscribers. \u201cWe had to remap the LabBook data model to obtain metrics for our ShipIt application,\u201d says Bender, who had worked on the social networking site when he first started at the Laboratory. The LabBook developers used multiple programming languages, such as SQL and PHP with HTML, to integrate the existing LabBook with the new model. \u201cBy the end of ShipIt, we had a full beta version of the application.\u201d One month later, the application was added to LabBook as part of a routine upgrade, allowing users to view scores that rank their influence on the site.\nBender sees the benefits of ShipIt from both an employee standpoint and that of the institution. \u201cThese types of events engage employees and motivate them to do something they wouldn\u2019t normally have considered, and that could potentially help Laboratory missions,\u201d he says. The team is already looking to improve the current version of the application, for example, by providing percentile rankings among users.\nLawrence Livermore is renowned for its high-performance computing environment and is home to some of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers and sophisticated software that optimizes these machines. For another ShipIt event, Cyrus Harrison, Brad Whitlock, and Ming Jiang collaborated with Harinarayan Krishnan from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to improve how LC customers access the results of simulations run on the Laboratory\u2019s systems.\nLC users have access to a personalized Web portal called MyLC that provides a wealth of information on their accounts, such as bank and disk usage, quotas, and active jobs on LC systems. Another application developed at Livermore is VisIt, a visualization tool for viewing and analyzing meshes produced by large-scale simulations. \u201cVisIt is an existing software framework and is quite complex. For ShipIt, our team wanted to expand the accessibility of VisIt by attempting to expose the application in the context of a Web browser,\u201d says Harrison.\nThe team developed a prototype of a MyLC portlet that helps users execute VisIt scripts and receive rendered or interactive views of data sets via a Web browser. For their final presentation, the software developers showed how simulation data rendered with VisIt could be viewed from a mobile phone. \u201cOur proof of concept demonstrates that a VisIt Web browser tool is viable and could be made available to all LC customers,\u201d says Harrison. A production-ready version of the tool, including quality assurance testing and debugging, would require additional time and resources outside the scope of ShipIt. However, the researchers agree that ShipIt allowed them to gain experience with a technology they had yet to work with.\nHarrison adds that another benefit to ShipIt is the project management aspect. \u201cBy having to assemble teams and develop a project schedule, participants get experience in project planning and organization,\u201d he says.

{"doc": {"text": "So, it seems that I blinked or blacked out or something and all the sudden it\u2019s been almost a whole year since I\u2019ve written anything on here. Oops!\nThere\u2019s a lot of reasons for that. I\u2019d itemize a list for you, but I\u2019d prefer to blather on endlessly because after all, that\u2019s what blogs are for.\nFor a long time, this blog was all about my \u201chomes on the road,\u201d which was a fun way to share cool places we camped all over the continent while full-time RVing. When that shindig ended, my blog (and I) felt a bit lost. I optimistically mused about blogging on topics like DIY house renovations, gardening, mom-hood, etc. But even now, 2+ years after being out of the full-time RV life, still none of that stuff makes that sense to me. At least not enough to pretend to be enough of an expert on to write about.\nFull-time travel? Of course, that was never as easy or glamorous as it probably appeared in small snippets every few weeks on your screen. But it made sense in my head, at least most of the time. House life? Mom life? None of that comes as naturally, and I sometimes feel like I\u2019m going through the motions of someone else\u2019s life while barely treading water.\nOver the years, I\u2019ve taken this blog to some semi-personal places but it\u2019s all been pretty travel-related, and that\u2019s my safe place. Owning a legit housing structure on a remote piece of property where the desert meets the forest and the mountains is its own adventure. So is keeping a small human alive, day in and day out. Yet writing about those things for all the world to see (correction: probably three friends and two stalkers) makes me want to squeeze myself under the bed and hide even though I don\u2019t fit down there.\nMeanwhile, more and more people I know aren\u2019t cool publicly sharing things online anymore, that whole concept is iffy with a baby, and talking about travel during COVID sometimes feels sketchy too. Other excuses I make for neglecting this blog are being too burnt out from writing for work to ever feel like writing for \u201cfun,\u201d being too generally exhausted from baby life to do anything creative, and being distracted by shiny things.\nBut alas, I feel crappy about letting my miniature corner of the world go to waste. It\u2019s a place I carved out to chitter-chatter about cool places without selling out or turning a passion project into yet another chore to weigh me down. In the meanwhile, I\u2019ve actually been traveling quite a bit since full-time camper life ended and exploring lots of awesome places around my home base in New Mexico. I\u2019ve also finally started to bust out of my comfort zone and meet some cool local people who are into some of the same stuff I am. Some of this deserves writing about, which is why I\u2019m here again to fill the void.\nEnough blather for you? Okay then. Moving on!\nBesides the blather, my actual goal with this post was to give a quick recap of cool places I\u2019ve been hanging out so far in 2021. Yet again, I considered venturing out to other topics for this blog but that didn\u2019t go so well. So, why not stick with the tried and true?\nSure, travel hasn\u2019t always been without its controversy his year, but I\u2019m not a dumb traveler\u2026.I\u2019m vaccinated, a responsible masker, a relentless planner, and an informed reader of reliable things. I\u2019ll always have a restless spirit and a wandering soul. But the Southwest still feels like home to me on most days, and I want to share that with you, dear world.\nSo, without further ado (and I think you\u2019d agree that there\u2019s been plenty of ado), here are some cool spots I\u2019ve been lately with one representative photo per place to keep it simple and moving along. Oh, and a few anecdotes because that\u2019s just what I do.\nTucson/Wilcox, Arizona \u2013 January 2021\nWhat better place to escape for the winter in the Southwest than Tucson? This camper trip was filled with wonderfully wearing tank tops in January, cool rock formations, iconic cacti, and buying some random pottery. So far, my baby hasn\u2019t fallen into a cactus, and I\u2019m trying to keep it that way.\nTaos/Angel Fire, New Mexico \u2013 February 2021\nDespite the adorable look on little Chikoo\u2019s face, snow isn\u2019t exactly his cup of tea. Regardless, we headed up to the Northern New Mexico ski resorts to get in some runs and playtime out in that white stuff.\nLas Cruces, New Mexico / El Paso, Texas \u2013 March 2021\nOne of Monkey\u2019s favorite places on the planet is White Sands National Park. The gypsum sand stays cool on even the hottest of days and is oh-so-soft on doggie paws. Yet the winds here are absolutely nuts, and this visit was no exception. We met our good Chicago friends, Bryina, here and following a winery/lunch stop nearby on a particularly awesome day. Other highlights from this camping trip were walking through the pueblo ruins, bike trails, and roadside antique shops selling super weird stuff.\nGrandparents Visit NM \u2013 April 2021\nApril was one of the rare months when we didn\u2019t leave the area for a camping excursion. My little man turned one year old in April, so Grandma and Grandpa drove out to New Mexico to celebrate. The local staycation involved the small man\u2019s first trip to the zoo, a sugary birthday cake, and a crazy number of new things to play with.\nSoutheast Utah \u2013 May 2021\nMay is always a big travel month for us\u2026it\u2019s the husband\u2019s birthday, our marriage anniversary, and a perfect time to be outdoors in the Southwest. Those red rock landscapes in Utah are my favorite places to be, and it\u2019d been too long since we\u2019ve been back among them. This trip included a first-time visit to Capitol Reef National Park, a revisit to Canyonlands National Park and Moab, and some random finds like Leprechaun Canyon and the Factory Buttle OHV area. Bonus points for an overnight in one of our favorite Colorado spots, Cortez, on the way back home. It was pretty much all hiking all the time, so definitely thanking the universe that the Chikoo rides awesomely in a baby hiking backpack.\nLadies\u2019 Weekend in ABQ & Jemez Springs \u2013 June 2021\nThis girl is my ride-or die. We text and video chat every day, but that\u2019s not always enough. She was awesome enough to fly out to see me in June so we could party it up downtown, go hiking, wine tasting, and get into random shenanigans along the way.\nArizona Pitstop \u2013 July 2021\nIt was 112 degrees outside, but that doesn\u2019t stop us from seeing awesome people. Arizona transplants, Chancy, met up with us for a delicious lunch and boat cruise on Saguaro Lake. There were good drinks, great views, and even better times hanging out. I give this day a solid two fist bumps, even when we spent a stupid amount of time loitering in a CVS just because it had air conditioning.\nSoCal/NorCal \u2013 July 2021\nNow this was a fun camper excursion. We set up camp just outside of San Diego and took the Chikoo to his very first beach, Imperial Beach. There were also splash pads, breweries, in-laws, more breweries, fun Cali friend meetups, and lovely weather. Bonus points for a fun rendezvous in Downtown Flagstaff on the way back.\nNorthwest New Mexico Birthday \u2013 August 2021\nThe time came to turn 38, so I may as well get on a boat about it, eh? Birthday celebrations took me to Northwest New Mexico with stops in Farmington, the Bisti Badlands, and Navajo Lake. Getting old isn\u2019t so bad when you\u2019re surrounded by scenery like this.\nLocal Adventures Close to Home \u2013 2021\nYet within a 30-minute or less from my house, I\u2019ve found plenty of other good stuff to do too. There have been a scattering public pools, cat cafes, brew spots, music festivals, playgrounds, trails, group hikes, and mom meetups\u2026not to mention monsoon season with its epic sunsets filled with lightning and double rainbows.\nDunno when I\u2019ll be back here\u2026maybe sooner, maybe later. But for now, my blog neglect guilt is absolved! And there\u2019s still plenty of 2021 left to go exploring.

Back in March I got a flat tire had to get a tow because two bolts on the tire broke during the process of changing the tire. I got towed to Discount Tire they told me they don't fix tire bolts. The tow truck operator told me he would check out Priority Auto but they were already closed according to Google. We drove there to what seemed like a closed shop but the guys although off the clock were helpful and fixed the bolts, put air in the spare tire and and got me back on the road. Very reasonable with pricing and professionalism. THEY DID NOT ATTEMPT TO UP SELL ME! I will be back very soon\nHad my f150 serviced here today. Was going to cost me an arm and a leg at the dealer and wouldnt be fixed till monday. Need it done asap since we are passing through. Looked up this place since it was close to the hotel.

Customer service was very polite and informative. The do get busy because they are highly recommend but they are worth the small wait time to get seen.\nThis company is second to none !!! That dude Steven might be the most honest person I've ever spoken to - If I were local I'd find reasons to take my car there\nWe went on a busy Saturday with two cars, short notice that we needed oil changes and tire rotations. Owner Steven was very accommodating to our situation and had both cars done in no time.

After all, the colour is only supposed to last for a short while, so I didn't mind trying a striking colour.\nBEFORE: I HAD SHORT BLACK HAIR WITH BROWN ENDS.\nCompared to normal hair dyes, the Aprilskin dye was not runny, so it was difficult to apply it evenly on my hair. I used the entire tube in hopes of getting a vibrant colour. Thankfully, the dye smelt nice and left my hair feeling really smooth!\nAFTER: MY HAIR ENDS WERE TINTED GREEN, BUT THE REST OF THE HEAD REMAIN OTHERWISE UNCHANGED.\nI was expecting a dark green or blue colour on my whole head, but all I got was a tinge of green on the ends of my hair, so I was a bit disappointed.

Skeptics cry shenanigans.\nIan Clifford wants to start a global revolution by building a practical, everyday car with no gasoline engine, no batteries, and no emissions.\nWhile big Detroit automakers ponder a future plug-in car that goes 40 miles on a battery charge before its gas engine kicks in, Mr. Clifford's tiny ZENN Motor, a Toronto maker of low-speed electric cars, announced in March that it will build a new highway-speed (80 m.p.h.) model that goes 250 miles on a charge \u2013 and can recharge in just five minutes.\nHaving no batteries, the new \"cityZENN\" model will use a breakthrough version of a common electrical storage device called an ultracapacitor to store power from a wall socket, the company says. Fuel costs to operate it would be about one-tenth of today's gas-powered vehicle.\nIf that astounding claim is real (and there are many skeptics), it could revolutionize automotive travel by making all-electric cars competitive with gas-powered vehicles and easing the world's dependence on oil.\n\"The big problem has always been the battery and its limits,\" says Clifford, ZENN's founder and CEO in a phone interview. \"This new technology is a 180-degree shift that represents the end of fossil fuel as a transportation fuel.\"\nThat's because the same ultracapacitor technology could be used across the grid to provide cheap electric storage for wind and solar power, he says. In turn, this process could power millions of ultracapacitor vehicles with no emissions at all. With the cars' fast-charge capability, recharging stations could pop up to help make even longer trips routine.\nUltracapacitors \u2013 also called supercapacitors \u2013 are more powerful cousins of the basic capacitor. With activated carbon at their core to act as a sponge for electrons, ultracapacitors can absorb power \u2013 or send a charge \u2013 far faster than batteries. They are also far more durable.\nFirst used in the 1960s, ultracapacitors today are widely found in electronic devices such as computers. In cameras, they retract and expand zoom lens. Yet the power stored by today's ultracapacitors is still only about 5 percent as much as a modern lithium-ion battery, far too little to power a car by themselves.\nThe reported breakthrough was made by ZENN's business partner EEStor, a Cedar Park, Texas, firm headed by respected computer industry veteran Richard Weir, who's named on the company's patent. The company is now nearing commercial production of its new \"electrical energy storage unit\" or EESU, Clifford says.\nBut privately held EEStor has had little to say publicly or to the press \u2013 and that secretiveness has inspired incredulity among many debating the topic on Internet forums.\nBut in a break with that tradition, Tom Weir, the company's vice president and general manager, responded to e-mailed questions.\n\"EEStor's technology has the opportunity to touch every aspect of daily life from very big to very small devices,\" Mr. Weir writes. \"We also see a whole new generation of products ... based around our technology.\"\nAdded credibility arrived with the January announcement by Lockheed Martin, the big defense company, of an agreement to use EEStor technology for military and homeland security applications. It refers to the EEStor \"ceramic battery\" providing \"10 times the energy density of lead-acid batteries at 1/10th the weight and volume.\"\nIn 2005, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers sunk $3 million into EEStor. ZENN also invested $3 million and will get exclusive rights to retrofit vehicles with the system \u2013 and produce new mid-size cars using EESUs.\nAccording to EEStor's patent application, the breakthrough is based on a technically arduous process of purifying and fabricating units with barium titanate, a material known to retain vast amounts of power.\n\"The main feature of the EESU is the charge and dis-charge at electric speed,\" Weir writes. \"This is a key enabling factor for the advancement of the next generation of vehicles. Another feature is the amount of power the EESU can store. Lastly, the EESU is expected to be considered fully 'green.' \"\nBut some bloggers call the purported breakthrough pure hype, today's version of \"cold fusion,\" the still-theoretical energy source announced in 1989.\nAt least some analysts and researchers, though skeptical, seem reluctant to dismiss entirely the possibility that EEStor could be onto something significant.\n\"I'm sure they do have a technology, but skepticism revolves around the fact that nobody knows much about it,\" says Anu Cherian, an analyst who tracks the $100 million global ultracapacitor market for Frost & Sullivan, a growth consulting company. \"The ZENN car looks to be an exciting development. But there's a lot of hype in the market.\"\nOther ultracapacitor experts won't dismiss EEStor's claim despite technical challenges.\n\"It would be unfair to make an analogy between what EEStor is doing and cold fusion,\" says Joel Schindall, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who is using nanotechnology to improve ultracapacitors. \"I don't doubt that they have built a device on a small scale that does store the amounts of energy they are talking about. I just don't know if they can manage the process of scaling it up ... for commercial applications.\"\nDr. Schindall and his colleagues hope soon to demonstrate a fivefold boost in ultracapacitor energy storage to up to 25 percent of the energy storage capacity of a lithium battery \u2013 and someday up to 50 percent \u2013 using a different approach to the problem.\nSuch significant advances would make ultracapacitors viable in vehicles, though they still fall far short of Clifford's claims about EESU.\nMaking commercial quantities of EESUs could prove challenging since even tiny impurities and defects in manufacturing could result in \"a violent discharge,\" Schindall notes.\nSafety is a huge issue for energy storage in vehicles whether powered by gasoline, ethanol, hydrogen, batteries \u2013 or ultracapacitors. High-capacity lithium-ion battery research for cars, for instance, is focused on ensuring those devices don't burst into flames. EEStor has ensured that its new ultracapacitor will be safe if damaged in a crash by \"instantly discharging to ground,\" Clifford says.\nSkeptics don't bother him, he says, because \"we've seen this product with our own eyes.\"\n\"We've had a great 100-year run with petroleum,\" Clifford says. \"But the time has come for all of us to come to our senses now and realize that the electric-powered era for cars has finally arrived.\"\nComments from EEStor\nMuch of the rampant skepticism on the Internet over whether or not EEStor has had a breakthrough in automotive propulsion stems from the company's reticence to speak or to demonstrate its product publicly. Only a handful of press releases have been issued since the company was formed, and press reports have rarely included any direct quotes from company managers. Below are comments from a Monitor e-mail interview with Tom Weir, vice president and general manager, EEStor, Inc.\nCan you offer an idea of what your product could do for automotive transportation and a time horizon for development?\n\"We see our Electrical Energy Storage Unit, 'EESU,' enabling the next generation of electric vehicles. The main feature of the EESU is [its ability to] charge and dis-charge at electric speed. This is a key enabling factor for the advancement of the next generation of vehicles. Another feature is the amount of power the EESU can store. Lastly, the EESU is expected to be considered fully 'green.' \"\nSome have suggested that ultracapacitors will play more of a supporting role \u2013 others that it's a \"game changer,\" or even world changing. How would you describe the potential?\n\"EEStor's technology has the opportunity to touch every aspect of daily life from very big to very small devices. We also see a whole new generation of products and services that [are] based around our technology.\"\nHow would you characterize EEStor's contribution to developing new systems to transmit the energy for automotive propulsion?\nEEStor has announced passing an evaluation on purity of its production process. Explain why this is important.\n\"To be discussed in the near future.\"\nWhy has EEStor been so quiet, some say secretive, about what it is doing?\n\"We talk about our achievements through press releases. We talk with our current customers almost daily. We will also talk about more things when the time is right.\"\nDo you see any show stoppers, or is it just a matter of ramping up?\n\"With any start-up you have some speed bumps that come up from time to time. We have no show stoppers.\"\nCompetitors rev their engines\nAt the North American International Auto Show in January, AFS Trinity created a stir by strutting its \"extreme hybrid\" plug-in concept vehicle that uses ultracapacitors to boost battery life and get 150 miles per gallon. The Bellevue, Wash.-based company sees ultracapacitors as a natural fit with new generation lithium-ion batteries that are vital to plug-in hybrids. Company chairman Edward Furia compares batteries to a long-distance runner (providing the stamina a car needs over the long haul) while ultracapacitors are akin to a weight lifter \u2013 giving cars that 0-to-60 oomph while minimizing impact on the delicate battery.\nAs oil prices rise, new ultracapacitor research has emerged. Companies like Maxwell Technologies, Panasonic, Nippon Chemi-Con, and others are working on advanced devices with attributes of both an ultracapacitor and a battery, according to a November report from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). But the recent focus is only a continuation of a long-term fascination with ultracapacitors in automobiles.\nA small fleet of ultracapacitor-powered buses began running in Moscow in 1995, and some garbage trucks in the US now use ultracapacitors to efficiently absorb energy from braking \u2013 and discharge it for acceleration, the IEEE article notes. Honda's Dualnote concept car in 2002 also showed off ultracapacitors' ability to instantly absorb braking energy and then return it in acceleration. German automaker BMW is also said to be evaluating ultracapacitors in their hybrid vehicles.", "id": "<urn:uuid:c7038a8c-b2b6-4e85-af3b-805358431456>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2015-14", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Living-Green/2008/0415/ultracapacitors-the-future-of-electric-cars-or-the-cold-fusion-of-autovation", "date": "2015-03-28T01:14:22Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-14/segments/1427131297146.11/warc/CC-MAIN-20150323172137-00036-ip-10-168-14-71.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9571179151535034, "token_count": 2260}, "content": [{"line": "Ultracapacitors: the future of electric cars or the 'cold fusion' of autovation?", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "ZENN Motors says its electric car will cruise for 250 miles on a single five-minute charge.

{"doc": {"text": "Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia dead at 92WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert C. Byrd, the longest serving member of the U.S. Senate, a fiery orator and hard-charging power broker who steered billions of federal dollars to his beloved West Virginia, died Monday. He was 92.\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert C. Byrd, the longest serving member of the U.S. Senate, a fiery orator and hard-charging power broker who steered billions of federal dollars to his beloved West Virginia, died Monday. He was 92.\nA spokesman for the family, Jesse Jacobs, said that Byrd died peacefully at about 3 a.m. at Inova Hospital in Fairfax, Va. He had been in the hospital since late last week.\nAt first Byrd was believed to be suffering from heat exhaustion and severe dehydration, but other medical conditions developed. He had been in frail health for several years.\nA man of humble, Depression-era upbringing, Byrd held his seat for over 50 years, working tirelessly all that time to make sure his state never missed out on its share \u2014 or even more, in some cases \u2014 of the federal largesse. He was the Senate\u2019s majority leader for six of those years and was third in the line of succession to the presidency, behind House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\nFlags at the Capitol and the White House flew at half-staff Monday as Washington mourned Byrd\u2019s passing. Byrd\u2019s desk in Senate chamber was draped in black.\nSen. Jay Rockefeller, a fellow West Virginian in the Senate, said it was his \u201cgreatest privilege\u201d to serve with Byrd.\n\u201cI looked up to him, I fought next to him, and I am deeply saddened that he is gone,\u201d Rockefeller said.\nThe Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said Byrd \u201ccombined a devotion to the U.S. Constitution with a deep learning of history to defend the interests of his state and the traditions of the Senate.\u201d\n\u201cWe will remember him for his fighter\u2019s spirit, his abiding faith, and for the many times he recalled the Senate to its purposes,\u201d McConnell said.\nFormer President Jimmy Carter said Byrd \u201cwas my closest and most valuable adviser\u201d during his presidency, when Byrd served as Senate majority leader. Byrd was skilled \u201cin using arcane Senate rules to achieve his goals, and was proud of his ability to count votes and forge prevailing coalitions,\u201d Carter said in a statement.\nWest Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, will appoint Byrd\u2019s replacement. For a declared vacancy more than two years and six months before the expiration of a senator\u2019s term \u2014 Byrd\u2019s term was to end Jan. 3, 2013 \u2014 the appointee serves until an election is held to fill the rest of the term.\nManchin issued a statement Monday saying Byrd \u201cwas a fearless fighter for the Constitution, his beloved state and its great people.\u201d He told The Associated Press that he will not appoint himself to fill the seat, and had no timetable for naming a replacement.\nByrd\u2019s death followed less than a year after the passing of venerable Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, a nationally recognizable figure who had been a most vociferous spokesman for liberal causes for years.\nIn comportment and style, Byrd often seemed a Senate throwback to a courtlier 19th century. He could recite poetry, quote the Bible, discuss the Constitutional Convention and detail the Peloponnesian Wars \u2014 and frequently did in Senate debates.\nYet there was nothing particularly courtly about Byrd\u2019s pursuit or exercise of power.\nByrd was a master of the Senate\u2019s bewildering rules and longtime chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which controls a third of the $3 trillion federal budget. He was willing to use both to reward friends and punish those he viewed as having slighted him.\n\u201cBob is a living encyclopedia, and legislative graveyards are filled with the bones of those who underestimated him,\u201d former House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, once said in remarks Byrd later displayed in his office.\nIn 1971, Byrd ousted Kennedy, the Massachusetts senator, as the Democrats\u2019 second in command. He was elected majority leader in 1976 and held the post until Democrats lost control of the Senate four years later. He remained his party\u2019s leader through six years in the minority, then spent another two years as majority leader.\nByrd stepped aside as majority leader in 1989 when Democrats sought a more contemporary television spokesman. \u201cI ran the Senate like a stern parent,\u201d Byrd wrote in his memoir, \u201cChild of the Appalachian Coalfields.\u201d His consolation price was the chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee, with control over almost limitless federal spending.\nWithin two years, he surpassed his announced five-year goal of making sure more than $1 billion in federal funds was sent back to West Virginia, money used to build highways, bridges, buildings and other facilities, some named after him.\nIn 2006 and with 64 percent of the vote, Byrd won an unprecedented ninth term in the Senate just months after surpassing South Carolinian Strom Thurmond\u2019s record as its longest-serving member. His more than 18,500 roll call votes were another record.\nBut Byrd also seemed to slow after the death of Erma, his wife of almost 69 years, in 2006. Frail and at times wistful, he used two canes to walk haltingly and needed help from aides to make his way about the Senate. He often hesitated at unscripted moments. By 2009, aides were bringing him to and from the Senate floor in a wheelchair.\nThough his hands trembled in later years, Byrd only recently lost his grip on power. Last November he surrendered his chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee.\nByrd\u2019s lodestar was protecting the Constitution. He frequently pulled out a dog-eared copy of it from a pocket in one of his trademark three-piece suits. He also defended the Senate in its age-old rivalry with the executive branch, no matter which party held the White House.\nUnlike other prominent Senate Democrats such as 2004 presidential nominee John Kerry of Massachusetts, who voted to authorize the war in Iraq, Byrd stood firm in opposition \u2014 and felt gratified when public opinion swung behind him.\n\u201cThe people are becoming more and more aware that we were hoodwinked, that the leaders of this country misrepresented or exaggerated the necessity for invading Iraq,\u201d Byrd said.\nHe cited Iraq when he endorsed then-Sen. Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination in May 2008, calling Obama \u201ca shining young statesman, who possesses the personal temperament and courage necessary to extricate our country from this costly misadventure.\u201d\nByrd\u2019s accomplishments followed a childhood of poverty in West Virginia, and his success on the national stage came despite a complicated history on racial matters. As a young man, he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan for a brief period, and he joined Southern Democrats in an unsuccessful filibuster against the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act.\nHe later apologized for both actions, saying intolerance has no place in America. While supporting later civil rights bills, he opposed busing to integrate schools.\nByrd briefly sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976 and later told associates he had once been approached by President Richard M. Nixon, a Republican, about accepting an appointment to the Supreme Court.\nBut he was a creature \u2014 and defender \u2014 of Congress across a career that began in 1952 with his election to the House. He served three terms there before winning his Senate seat in 1958, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was in the White House.\nHe clashed with presidents in both parties and was implacably against proposed balanced budget amendments to the Constitution.\n\u201cHe is a fierce defender of the Senate and its prerogatives in ways that I think the founding fathers really intended the Senate to be,\u201d said one-time rival Kennedy.\nIn a measure of his tenacity, Byrd took a decade of night courses to earn a law degree in 1963, and completed his long-delayed bachelor\u2019s degree at West Virginia\u2019s Marshall University in 1994 with correspondence classes.\nByrd was a near-deity in economically struggling West Virginia, to which he delivered countless federally financed projects. Entire government bureaus opened there, including the FBI\u2019s repository for computerized fingerprint records. Even the Coast Guard had a facility in the landlocked state. Critics portrayed him as the personification of Congress\u2019 thirst for wasteful \u201cpork\u201d spending projects.\nRobert Carlyle Byrd was born Nov. 20, 1917, in North Wilkesboro, N.C., as Cornelius Calvin Sale Jr., the youngest of five children.\nBefore he was 1, his mother died and his father sent him to live with an aunt and uncle, Vlurma and Titus Byrd, who renamed him and moved to the coal-mining town of Stotesbury, W.Va. He didn\u2019t learn his original name until he was 16 and his real birthday until he was 54.\nByrd\u2019s foster father was a miner who frequently changed jobs, and Byrd recalled that the family\u2019s house was \u201cwithout electricity, ... no running water, no telephone, a little wooden outhouse.\u201d\nHe graduated from high school but could not afford college. Married in 1936 to high school sweetheart Erma Ora James \u2014 with whom he had two daughters \u2014 he pumped gas, cut meat and during World War II was a shipyard welder.\nReturning to meat cutting in West Virginia, he became popular for his fundamentalist Bible lectures. A grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan suggested he run for office.\nHe won his first race \u2014 for the state\u2019s House of Delegates \u2014 in 1946, distinguishing himself from 12 rivals by singing and fiddling mountain tunes. His fiddle became a fixture; he later played it on the television show \u201cHee Haw\u201d and recorded an album. He abandoned it only after a grandson\u2019s traumatic death in 1982 and when his shaky hands left him unable to play.\nAt his 90th birthday party in 2007, however, Byrd joined bluegrass band Lonesome Highway in singing a few tunes and topped off the night with a rendition of \u201cOld Joe Clark.\u201d\nAfter six years in the West Virginia legislature, Byrd was elected to the U.S. House in 1952 in a race in which his brief Klan membership became an issue. He said he joined because of its anti-communism.\nByrd entered Congress as one of its most conservative Democrats. He was an early supporter of the Vietnam War, and his 14-hour, 13-minute filibuster against the 1964 civil rights bill remains one of the longest ever. His views gradually moderated, particularly on economic issues, but he always sided with his state\u2019s coal interests in confrontations with environmentalists.\nHis love of Senate traditions inspired him to write a four-volume history of the chamber. It also led him to oppose laptops on the Senate floor and to object when a blind aide tried bringing her seeing-eye dog into the chamber.\nIn 2004, Byrd got Congress to require schools and colleges to teach about the Constitution every Sept. 17, the day the document was adopted in 1787.", "id": "<urn:uuid:0b41cc9f-69a1-42ad-9606-4c0934567398>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.mitchellrepublic.com/event/article/id/44246/", "date": "2013-05-19T02:17:11Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696383156/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092623-00001-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9827306866645813, "token_count": 2385}, "content": [{"line": "Sen.

{"doc": {"text": "Wrapping Up A Drama-Filled Weekend\nIn a way, I almost enjoy coming to qualifying weekend more than the race\u2026almost. There are so many storylines and subplots that develop throughout the weekend that come to a head in the last thirty minutes on Sunday afternoon. This year was no different.\nThe weather was certainly a factor, as it usually is. As it turned out, it just served to make things more interesting as it created a sense of urgency for several drivers \u2013 most notably, Danica Patrick. Say what you will about Ms. Patrick (I know I have), but she showed guts today. When, at one point, it looked like the rain may prevent her from even attempting a run to get into the field today, she was the first out when the track finally dried out. She responded by turning the fastest lap of the entire day and putting her car safely in the field.\nPaul Tracy turned in the fastest four-lap average of the day and put his WIX Filters Dallara on the inside of Row Nine. Ryan Briscoe also answered the bell by putting his car on the outside of the ninth row. Charlie Kimball also solidly joined his teammate, Graham Rahal, who qualified just before the big storm came earlier in the day.\nBut the main story was brewing near the back of the field. I had an idea that there would be an Andretti Autosport driver to not make this field. What I did not expect was that two wouldn\u2019t make it. I suspected that Mike Conway wouldn\u2019t make the race, since he had been slow all month. What surprised me was that Ryan Hunter-Reay didn\u2019t make it either. Marco Andretti was bumped by Alex Lloyd, but bumped his teammate, Hunter-Reay, to get back in.\nHow does this happen? How does a team like Andretti Autosport allow themselves to have all four of their full-time drivers be shut out on the first day and then most of them hanging around the last row on the second day. This wasn\u2019t as shocking as Marlboro Team Penske\u2019s No-Show in 1995, but it was close.\nThe others that ended the day on the outside looking in were Sebastian Saavedra, James Jakes, Ho-Pin Tung, Scott Speed and Rafa Matos. Most experts agreed that one full-time driver would be going home. I don\u2019t think anyone saw three not making the field. This is certainly an intriguing grid. I think that there is now a good chance that the winning car may actually come from a non-Penske/Ganassi stable. I\u2019m a Penske fan, but that could be good for driving fan interest in the sport. So let all the weeklong speculation begin. It\u2019s going to be a fun week.\n* \u2013 Note: As soon as this post loads up, we are piling in the car and headed back to Nashville. I must be at work by 8:00 Monday morning. There will be no post here on Monday, but I\u2019ll try to have something up here most days this week leading up to the race.

The Sydney Morning Herald (referenced below) contained an article entitled, \u201cWitching hour at Peter Dutton\u2019s office as protestors call for sacking over text\u201d. Let me quote \u2026\n\u201cThe term \u2018witch\u2019 is generally thought of as a gendered insult when used by men to describe women. Feminist author and commentator Jane Caro told Faifax Media: By saying mad fucking witch you are actually painting a picture of something that is very different from \u201cmad fucking idiot\u201d, which would have been fine because it is an equal opportunity insult\u201d\nAn EQUAL OPPORTUNITY INSULT \u2026 WTF? Leslie Nielsen (yep Leslie can be a boys name) could respond best. Surely you aren\u2019t serious?

The article goes on to recommend Mr Dutton be sacked \u2026 and replaced by a woman (one proficient in the use of mobile technology I presume?).\nIn a parallel Universe, a politician (call him Mr Button) accidentally sent a text (meant for a parliamentary colleague) to a male journalist calling him a \u201cmad fucking warlock\u201d. And, curiously, NOBODY jumped to the journo\u2019s aid by trotting out an \u201cequal opportunity insult\u201d defense. How would it even go? Ahh Mr Button you shouldn\u2019t refer to Barnaby Joyce as a warlock it would be more appropriate and non-gender-offensive to call him a mad fucking idiot?\nMeanwhile, back in our universe, the following occurred:\n- A father drove himself and his 2 young sons off a wharf in SA in a murder-suicide. Details about WHY have been suppressed by the media to protect the public ???;\n- A passenger on a domestic flight in WA groped cabin crew. It was never reported in the media and went unpunished ???;\n- A man committed domestic violence against his wife \u2026 and the wife\u2019s mother encouraged her to go back to him ???;\n- A young man dies in an early morning one-punch attack in a Brisbane nightclub precinct;\n- George Pell continues to avoid the Royal Commission into child abuse in the church due to \u201cill health\u201d but is fit to be in his workplace managing the Catholic Churches finances at the Vatican (talk about a discriminating workplace);\n- AFL player Dustin Martin remains \u201cunpunished\u201d after his accuser WAS prepared to do a TV interview (dentist style and for her employers network) but WASN\u2019T prepared to undertake a formal police interview;\n- Donald Trump offends or discriminates against a new group every day \u2026 and continues to be a presidential candidate. [edit as at 20/1/17 he is now POTUS \u2026]\nViolence is violence. Discrimination is discrimination. Abuse is abuse. If you threaten ANYONE with violence THAT is the issue. Not gender.

{"doc": {"text": "Field of view\nThe field of view (also field of vision, abbreviated FOV) is the extent of the observable world that is seen at any given moment. In case of optical instruments or sensors it is a solid angle through which a detector is sensitive to electromagnetic radiation.\nHumans and animals\nDifferent animals have different fields of view, depending on the placement of the eyes. Humans have an almost 180-degree forward-facing horizontal field of view, while some birds have a complete or nearly complete 360-degree field of view. The vertical range of the field of view in humans is typically around 135 degrees.\nThe range of visual abilities is not uniform across a field of view, and varies from animal to animal. For example, binocular vision, which is important for depth perception, covers only 114 degrees (horizontally) of the field of vision in humans; the remaining peripheral 60\u201370 degrees have no binocular vision (because only one eye can see those parts of the field of view). Some birds have a scant 10 or 20 degrees of binocular vision.\nSimilarly, color vision and the ability to perceive shape and motion vary across the field of view; in humans the former is concentrated in the center of the visual field, while the latter tends to be much stronger in the periphery. This is due to the much higher concentration of color-sensitive cone cells in the fovea, the central region of the retina, in comparison to the higher concentration of motion-sensitive rod cells in the periphery. Since cone cells require considerably brighter light sources to be activated, the result of this distribution is that peripheral vision is much stronger at night relative to binocular vision.\nMany optical instruments, particularly binoculars or spotting scopes, are advertised with their field of view specified in one of two ways: angular field of view, and linear field of view. Angular field of view is typically specified in degrees, while linear field of view is a ratio of lengths. For example, binoculars with a 5.8 degree (angular) field of view might be advertised as having a (linear) field of view of 305 ft per 1000 yd or 102 mm per meter. As long as the FOV is less than about 10 degrees or so, the following approximation formulas allow one to convert between linear and angular field of view. Let be the angular field of view in degrees. Let be the linear field of view in feet per 1000 yd. Let be the linear field of view in millimeters per meter. Then, using the small-angle approximation:\nIn machine vision the lens focal length and image sensor size sets up the fixed relationship between the field of view and the working distance. Field of view is the area of the inspection captured on the camera\u2019s imager. The size of the field of view and the size of the camera\u2019s imager directly affect the image resolution (one determining factor in accuracy). Working distance is the distance between the back of the lens and the target object.\nIn remote sensing, the solid angle through which a detector element (a pixel sensor) is sensitive to electromagnetic radiation at any one time, is called instantaneous field of view or IFOV. A measure of the spatial resolution of a remote sensing imaging system, it is often expressed as dimensions of visible ground area, for some known sensor altitude. Single pixel IFOV is closely related to concept of resolved pixel size, ground resolved distance, ground sample distance and modulation transfer function.\nIn astronomy the field of view is usually expressed as an angular area viewed by the instrument, in square degrees, or for higher magnification instruments, in square arc-minutes. For reference the Wide Field Channel on the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope has a field of view of 10 sq. arc-minutes, and the High Resolution Channel of the same instrument has a field of view of 0.15 sq. arc-minutes. Ground based survey telescopes have much wider fields of view. The photographic plates used by the UK Schmidt Telescope had a field of view of 30 sq. degrees. The 1.8 m (71 in) Pan-STARRS telescope, with the most advanced digital camera to date has a field of view of 7 sq. degrees. In the near infra-red WFCAM on UKIRT has a field of view of 0.2 sq. degrees and the forthcoming VISTA telescope will have a field of view of 0.6 sq. degrees. Until recently digital cameras could only cover a small field of view compared to photographic plates, although they beat photographic plates in quantum efficiency, linearity and dynamic range, as well as being much easier to process.\nIn photography, the field of view is that part of the world that is visible through the camera at a particular position and orientation in space; objects outside the FOV when the picture is taken are not recorded in the photograph. It is most often expressed as the angular size of the view cone, as an angle of view. For normal lens, field of view can be calculated FOV = 2 arctan(SensorSize/2f), where f is Focal Length.\n- \"Cascading Milky Way\". ESO Picture of the Week.

{"doc": {"text": "PM and Montek rubbish Sibal's telecom proposal\nBy Sps Pannu\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh has trashed telecom minister Kapil Sibal's proposal to unilaterally amend the government's licensing agreement with existing telecom companies and force them to pay auction-determined prices for the spectrum they currently hold.\nThe PM put his stamp of approval on the finance ministry views in response to a draft note circulated to various ministries in preparation for a Cabinet meeting scheduled for Tuesday.\nSibal seems to be buffeted between the PM and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, who has similarly raised Cain over amending the licensing agreement.\nOpposed: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia\nAccording to sources, Sibal's proposal would have gone against the interests of dual technology companies Tata Teleservices and RCom and benefited GSM operators Bharti Airtel and Vodafone.\nThe licenses of dual technology companies are valid till 2021 and beyond, while those of the GSM players are due for renewal a good seven years earlier in 2014-15. The dual technology companies would, therefore, end up losing a lot more than the GSM players if the department of telecommunications (DoT) proposal is pushed through.\nThe PM has, as finance minister, made it clear that the sanctity of contracts need to be weighed carefully, thus implying that this would not be the case if the DoT proposal of unilaterally amending the licence was to be implemented.\nCabinet Minister for Human Resource Development (HRD), Communications and Information Technology Kapil Sibal\nThe finance ministry has pointed out that the government has allotted the start-up spectrum and contracted spectrum to the existing players and by doing so has acquired certain contractual obligations for the duration of the licence.\nThe PM has come out in favour of a careful assessment of the impact on investor sentiment that frequent changes in contract terms may have. The impact on foreign investors is also considered important and has come up for special mention.\nThe Sibal-headed DoT, on the other hand, appears to be banking on the \"level playing field\" argument for old and new players in its proposal to charge auction- determined prices.\nThe finance ministry's logic is in sync with the views of the Planning Commission, which has gone into the issue in considerable detail.\nThe Commission has also stated that the terms of the unified access (UAS) licence give the government the power to change the terms at any time.\n'This is indeed a wide ranging power, but is usually meant to be used in an extreme case. If it is interpreted to mean that any change can be used at any time, it becomes to open ended, leading to uncertainty. It is doubtful that banks or other investors will finance telecom investments if the terms of licences are subject to such open ended certainty,' it concludes.\nAccording to the Planning Commission, the only rationale for the change seems to be that there should be a level playing field between new and incumbent operators. It has observed that all industries see new entrants entering at different times.\n'New entrants always incur different costs and very often face different tax environments from what the incumbents faced. For example, if interest rates have risen at a time when new incumbents are investing, they have a disadvantage over existing incumbents but interest rates are rationalised retrospectively on all outstanding loans of existing incumbents. New entrants in telecom are entering a field where the advantage of existing incumbents are known and it will be reflected in the competitive bid for the spectrum,' the Planning Commission further argued.\nMeanwhile, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar on Monday evening recused himself from heading the Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) on telecom, three days after he replaced Pranab Mukherjee in the job.\nPawar, who was scheduled to chair the first meeting of the new EGoM, postponed the meeting and then wrote to the Prime Minister recalling how attempts were made in the past to drag him in the 2G controversy and that it would be appropriate for him to recuse himself.", "id": "<urn:uuid:4272306f-50b5-4b23-a92c-29860bcff6c2>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2167820/PM-Montek-rubbish-Sibals-telecom-proposal.html?ito=feeds-newsxml", "date": "2013-05-23T11:34:39Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368703298047/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516112138-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9649715423583984, "token_count": 846}, "content": [{"line": "PM and Montek rubbish Sibal's telecom proposal", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "By Sps Pannu", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has trashed telecom minister Kapil Sibal's proposal to unilaterally amend the government's licensing agreement with existing telecom companies and force them to pay auction-determined prices for the spectrum they currently hold.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "The PM put his stamp of approval on the finance ministry views in response to a draft note circulated to various ministries in preparation for a Cabinet meeting scheduled for Tuesday.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Sibal seems to be buffeted between the PM and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, who has similarly raised Cain over amending the licensing agreement.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Opposed: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "According to sources, Sibal's proposal would have gone against the interests of dual technology companies Tata Teleservices and RCom and benefited GSM operators Bharti Airtel and Vodafone.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "The licenses of dual technology companies are valid till 2021 and beyond, while those of the GSM players are due for renewal a good seven years earlier in 2014-15.

Criteria for selection include the promotion/development of library services that enrich a library\u2019s staff and community, the promotion/development of community or institutional support of the library, involvement in groups (not library-specific) which promote the library profession, and a record of professional leadership.\n\u201cJay Scherma has provided tremendous service and leadership to his community of Cape Elizabeth as well as the Maine library community as a whole. In his state-wide library leadership roles, including serving as MLA President 2000-2002, Jay has been a champion for patron access to information, intellectual freedom, and collaborative, cost-efficient resource sharing,\u201d said Sarah Sugden, Chair of the MLA Awards Committee. \u201cHe is so attuned to the needs and interests of his community that it was little surprise to learn that a Cape Elizabeth community survey found that 9-out-of-10 residents are satisfied with their library.\u201d\nScherma\u2019s service to the Maine library community includes his aforementioned term as MLA President, Chair of the Maine Libraries Conference (1999-2000), Chair of Conference\u2019s Vendor Committee (2004-2008), and the Minerva Library Network Executive Board (2008-2011), in addition to serving as Minerva Treasurer.

{"doc": {"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Nicklas Backstrom isn\u2019t leaving the team he lifted the Stanley Cup with and is getting paid handsomely to stick around for the long haul.\nThe Washington Capitals on Tuesday signed Backstrom to a $46 million, five-year contract extension that locks him up through the 2024-25 season. The playmaking Swedish center will count $9.2 million against the salary cap when this contract kicks in next season, a significant raise from his current team-friendly deal.\n\u201cI had one goal in mind, and that was to stay here,\u201d Backstrom said at a news conference. \u201cI love the city, I love the fans and love the organization, so it was no doubt in my mind. It would be really weird to put on a different jersey.\u201d\nThere was little doubt Backstrom and the Capitals would get a deal done before the 32-year-old could become an unrestricted free agent on July 1. Along with captain Alex Ovechkin, Backstrom has been a cornerstone of the franchise for more than a decade. He was a key part of the 2018 Cup run and his No. 19 jersey will someday hang in the rafters.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting a whole lot when I first got drafted,\u201d Backstrom said. \u201cEver since, it\u2019s been a journey.\u201d\nBackstrom and Ovechkin have played more than 900 games together since Backstrom\u2019s NHL debut in 2007 and became one of hockey\u2019s most dynamic duos during this era.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be with a guy on the same team so many years,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cYou can ask anybody in this locker room or previous guys who played. First of all, he\u2019s tremendous person and an unbelievable center. To be around him and see how he\u2019s grown up, how he\u2019s matured, it\u2019s great.\u201d\nBackstrom is the Capitals\u2019 franchise leader in assists and has put up 908 points in 934 regular-season games. He recorded 23 points in 20 playoff games during Washington\u2019s Cup run and has been a part of 11 playoff appearances in 12 years.\nOvechkin wears the \u201cC,\u201d but Backstrom has built up years of respect and admiration from teammates as a leader.\n\u201cBecause of how he plays and how he carries himself, his word has some backbone to it,\u201d said former Capitals defenseman Matt Niskanen, who now plays for Philadelphia. \u201cHe has a lot of credibility because of the things he\u2019s accomplished, and he plays the game the right way. He\u2019s a really solid 200-foot player, which is what you want from your stars.\u201d\nThis season, Backstrom has nine goals and 26 assists for 35 points. He\u2019s the only active player to have 50-plus assists in each of the past six seasons.\n\u201cI think he already is one of the all-time greats that\u2019s ever played here,\u201d team president Dick Patrick said. \u201cHe\u2019s just the type of player that you want to stay forever.\u201d\nMuch like Ovechkin did with his $124 million, 13-year contract signed in 2008 \u2014 with help from his mother \u2014 Backstrom negotiated this deal himself. He\u2019ll be 37 when it\u2019s over, leaving open the possibility of another contract for a player who seems like he\u2019ll finish his career with the Capitals.\n\u201cI\u2019m still not super, super old,\u201d Backstrom said. \u201cBut the main reason that I wanted to stay here is we have a chance to win again. As a hockey player, that\u2019s all you think about.\u201d\nOvechkin almost certainly will play his entire NHL career with Washington, and his contract status is one of two situations worth watching now that Backstrom is signed. The Russian superstar who\u2019s on the verge of reaching 700 goals is signed through next season, so he and the Capitals could sign an extension as early as this summer.\nKeeping Backstrom around and likely re-upping Ovechkin are obvious moves for the Capitals, who face a different situation with pending free agent goaltender Braden Holtby. The 2016 Vezina Trophy winner could leave this summer because Washington is up against the salary cap and has top prospect Ilya Samsonov already in the NHL and looking like he\u2019s capable of becoming a starter.\n\u201cIt is tricky,\u201d MacLellan said. \u201cHoltby\u2019s a big part of our success as an organization and he\u2019s in the mix with Ovi and Nick as defining our organization. I think we had an open communication at the beginning of the year and then we were going to address it at the end of the year to see where we\u2019re at with cap and possibilities or not possibilities. So we\u2019re going to play it out.\u201d\nEven with 2018 playoff leading scorer Evgeny Kuznetsov signed long term and Lars Eller under contract, the Capitals didn\u2019t have a successor for Backstrom, a point-a-game center who has helped Ovechkin become the best goal-scorer of this generation.\n\u201cI\u2019m more of a passer, and he\u2019s a pure-goal scorer, I think,\u201d Backstrom said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s worked out so good.\u201d\nFollow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "id": "<urn:uuid:e8536437-d01d-4bc2-a170-89c066ec20bc>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2020-45", "url": "https://www.wric.com/sports/sports-headlines/capitals-sign-nicklas-backstrom-for-5-year-46m-deal/", "date": "2020-10-28T08:20:05Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2020-45/segments/1603107897022.61/warc/CC-MAIN-20201028073614-20201028103614-00320.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9748455882072449, "token_count": 1225}, "content": [{"line": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Nicklas Backstrom isn\u2019t leaving the team he lifted the Stanley Cup with and is getting paid handsomely to stick around for the long haul.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "The Washington Capitals on Tuesday signed Backstrom to a $46 million, five-year contract extension that locks him up through the 2024-25 season.

{"doc": {"text": "The church calls me to my best self, the Eden self, the person God created me to be. In church I shed my old skin, shuffle off the hurtful and ugly like cicada husks hiding with the dust bunnies under the pews.\nI wriggle off that judgment that doesn\u2019t fit anymore, or that idea of God that ended up being way too small, and I\u2019m given something else. A second chance. Some grace which I may or may not find amazing at the time. It\u2019s like I take off the burlap sack and get to put on a cashmere robe. And then someone hands me a cookie and a cup of fair trade coffee.\nChurch, and worship in particular, shapes me. It forms the pattern of my days: quiet reflection, expressions of gratitude, responding to challenges and teachings, spontaneous song. People in need and people in joy.\nI haven\u2019t been at church for a month but I have been with church and in church. More cards than I can count. More prayers than I know of. Books and magazines. Food, food, and more food. People who take me out for a walk. People who tell me not to worry about it. People who say they miss me.\nI miss them, and I miss worship, which for me is the core of church. On a usual Sunday when it\u2019s time I zip up my robe and adjust my stole and get the microphone clipped on. We pastors say a prayer together, and I pick up my papers and we head down the stairs and make our way through the sanctuary to the back.\nAnd then the acolytes\u2019 wicks are lit, and we start down the aisle. We sit down and while the prelude finishes, I look out at the congregation, at the church. There they are, the saints and sinners, my sisters and brothers and friends. There they are, the sick, the grieving, the joyous, the angry, the wondering, the frazzled, the bored. There they are, the sinews and ligaments and bones and muscles and cells of the body of Christ. There they are, the church, surrounded by stained glass and pews and unbelievable music all of which adorn the church but aren\u2019t church. The people are church.\nIn the next hour we sing and pray and listen and speak. Hopefully we laugh. Often at least one person cries. And when we leave after the benediction and postlude, and make our way home after a cup of tea or a meeting or lunch with the usual crowd, we take church to the streets, to our homes and work places and schools and the neighborhood. We present the pattern to the world: reflection, gratitude, response, song; hope. Church doesn\u2019t need a building, though that makes it convenient.

Spiritual progress. generosity, expansion.\nEmotionally: Resigned to the fact, giving up, determined to succeed, enthusiasm\nThe swords on the card: Cutting implement, insight as in getting right to the bottom of something, defensive action, authority, conflict, triumph against the odds. justice and law, natural authority.\nThe blindfold: Unwilling to see the reality of what is right in front of you or a situation\nBinding: Limitation in current events usually self imposed, not willing to take action or accountability.\nThis card points to being a prisoner of your own making. A woman stands bound and blindfolded; with swords to either side of her. She must navigate a narrow path in front of her. One foot touches the water. That is her left foot and as I have mentioned before the left hand side of the body is ruled by female energy such as intuition emotions etc. The right hand side is male energy, action, earthly, strength and control etc.\nSo in saying this we can deduce that the woman is weighing things up. She must be very careful in this endeavour and would be well advised to remove the blindfold and the body binding in order to see what lies in front of her. Those bindings and blindfold are self inflicted by the way. The restrictions as to what she has done and thus restricting herself to any positive outcomes. She is not willing to face the reality of her own actions.\nRight behind her is a castle which signifies her power and wealth that she comes from. Signifying, authority, structure, preservation of what was or is. The mountains in the far distance show the long journey that she is on, she cannot turn back either due to her choices or decisions that she made whether for good or bad. Right now she faces major hurdles of her own making and this sums up the world's current situation right now. There does not seem on the surface to be much real authority and structure as things are very much up in the air at present and everyone is feeling defensive and restricted. No clear thinking of what to do to keep things stable.\nThe world is on a precipice right now; one wrong move and boom; things can explode setting in motion a direction that may not be good for humanity and may not be able to be stopped. People are right to be very nervous and cautious. But look behind the scenes of world events right now, there are clear signs of deception and illusion, nothing is by chance. The stage has been set by hidden hands for the chain of events that follow. Things that were set in place many years ago are now \u201ccoming home to roost\u201d.

Because they have to choose between paying a bill or eating this is working people they are the new poor. Now as I look at the card, I see a flash of yellow/golden light cascading down the castle. That can imply happiness and spiritual protection around the home front (family home). The swords stand protectively in front of the castle which is built high up on a rock also implying a fortress and protection.

Save what you can and protect what you have. Because it can be gone in an instant as many poor souls have found out already via war, unemployment, floods and natural disasters.

{"doc": {"text": "Former St. Joseph's Hospital\nSt. Joseph's Hospital\nSt. Joseph's Apartments\nLinks and documents\nListed on the Canadian Register:\nStatement of Significance\nDescription of Historic Place\nSt. Joseph's Hospital is a four-and-one-half storey plus basement stone Neoclassical Edwardian structure located across the street from St. Ann's Academy. The designation also includes interior features.\nSt. Joseph's Hospital, built in 1876 with additions in 1888, 1897, and 1908, is valued for its association with the Sisters of St. Ann, its connection with the health care of Victoria's citizens, its architecture and architect, and its grounds.\nSt. Joseph's Hospital has value for its association with one of British Columbia's major pioneering religious orders, and for its role in the provision of health care in the region. It is a prominent reminder of the importance of the Sisters of St. Ann to the physical well-being of Victoria's citizens.\nFounded in Quebec in 1848, the Sisters of St. Ann represent the strong presence of French-Canadian missionaries in British Columbia's formative history. From the Pacific Northwest headquarters of the order at St. Ann's Academy, directly across Humboldt Street from this building, they gradually expanded their missionary work in Victoria to include a school, a convent, a novitiate program, and nursing services to better serve the educational, medical, and spiritual needs of the population for over a century.\nArchitecturally, the historic place was designed and built in stages, but it is the 1908 addition by Thomas Hooper and C. Elwood Watkins that is most prominent in today's configuration. The first phase of St. Joseph's Hospital was built on Collinson Street (now renamed Fairfield Road) in 1876 under the leadership of Sister Mary Providence and Dr. John Sebastian Helmcken. In 1888, an additional 48 beds were added, and in 1897, another 67, bringing the total to 150. The 1908 addition was designed to face Humboldt Street. With its Edwardian solidity and strong Neoclassical features, it serves as a foil to the Hooper wing at St. Ann's Academy and further reinforces the significance of the Order in Victoria's development. A historic chapel on the northeast of the structure has been preserved and provides a visual link to the religious past. Several interior features have been retained, further enhancing the historic importance of this building. It has been rehabilitated for use as seniors' housing with units for transient accommodation.\nIn addition, the grounds contribute to Victoria's natural environment.

They typically have a daily routine that involves eating, drinking, eliminating, socializing, sleeping, and digging. Pigs are very intelligent and need environmental enrichment, or they can become bored and destructive. Pet pigs that are not provided with appropriate environmental enrichment or are not socialized early in life may develop stereotypical behaviors including pacing, staring, excessive drinking, hitting walls, drooling, rubbing on things excessively, and repeated licking or chewing on objects, especially metal and rope. Ideally, pigs should be allowed to root outside in untreated lawn. If they are not allowed access to an area for rooting, they may dig up floors, carpeting, or walls in your home, and chew up house plants. Pet pigs can suddenly become aggressive in response to changes within a household including a change in caretaker schedule, introduction of new pets and people, and discomfort from illness.\nLike other pets and people, mini-pigs can suffer from numerous health problems including inner/middle ear infections, foot abnormalities, atrophic rhinitis, pneumonia, intestinal parasites and obesity. Obesity can lead to joint injury and arthritis. Mini-pigs may ingest inappropriate items leading to gastrointestinal tract blockages. If blockages are not dealt with quickly intestinal rupture and death. obesity and are prone to joint injury, arthritis, and foot abnormalities.\nYoung, male mini-pigs commonly develop urolithiasis in which uroliths form lodge in their urethras, causing life-threatening urinary tract obstructions. Male mini-pigs also suffer from cryptorchidism, in which the testicles fail to move from inside the abdomen to the groin. Older, un-spayed female pigs commonly develop leiomyoma uterine tumors. Two common eye problems are entropion (the eyelids roll inward, toward the eyeball) and distichiasis (in which eyelashes on the upper eyelid are misdirected, so that they point in toward and rub on the eyeball). Erysipelas is a bacterial infection characterized by diamond-shaped, red, raised skin lesions that is fatal but is preventable with vaccination. Because mini-pigs are non-discriminatory eaters, they tend to eat all sorts of inappropriate things, including rodenticides which can be deadly if not treated quickly.\nPigs are omnivores that typically eat multiple small meals throughout the day. A mini-pig\u2019s base diet should consist of a commercially available, nutritionally balanced pelleted chow formulated for mini-pigs. Different formulations are available based on the life stage of the pig. In addition to pelleted pig chow, pigs may be fed small amounts of other foods, including fresh or frozen vegetables and small amounts of fruit. Pelleted food should be offered first to help ensure it is consuming a balanced diet. The exact amount of pelleted food to feed depends on the brand being fed; most brands give general feeding recommendations calculated from their caloric content. Treats such as small pieces of succulent fruits or vegetables may be offered once or twice a day and are best used as rewards in training.\nThere are many breeds of miniature pigs, including the Vietnamese pot-bellied pig. In addition to pot-bellied pigs, the term mini-pig includes an additional 14 recognized breeds of small pigs including Julianas and KuneKunes. Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs can be as heavy as 200 pounds, reach a height of 14-20 inches at the shoulders and typically live for 14-21 years. Mini-pigs communicate both with sounds and with body language. Mini-pigs should never be left alone unsupervised with even the friendliest, potentially predatory, dogs and cats. Mini-pigs are very smart and can be trained to walk on a leash/harness and to sit, stay, come, and retrieve objects.\nMini-pigs may be housed successfully inside if they are given enough space, an area in which to root, and proper environmental enrichment. Ideally pet pigs should have access to a safe area of untreated lawn outside in which to root and chew on grass. Pet pigs generally like to urinate and defecate in a single area that is far from where they eat and sleep and can be trained to eliminate either inside and outside. Pigs in urban environments may be taught to walk on a leash/harness and go outside like dogs.

{"doc": {"text": "Courtney Howard is a LAFCA, OFCS and AWFJ member, as well as a Rotten Tomatometer-approved film critic. Her work has been published on Variety, She Knows and Awards Circuit.\nCourtney Howard // Film Critic\nThe compelling new documentary DYING LAUGHING takes a look at the brave souls who put themselves in the harsh stage spotlight night after night in the attempt to make us chuckle. The life of a stand-up comic is one that\u2019s filled with hecklers, heartbreak, but also hope for society\u2019s betterment as the key to success can be found in laughter. Directors Lloyd Stanton and Paul Toogood have examined the craft of rocking a rhyme in THE ART OF RAP, and they utilize a similar technique to get to the heart of what makes stand-up comedians tick.\nI spoke with the affable directors by phone recently about everything from showing different aspects of the fine art of stand-up comedy, to the insights they learned about the craft, to continuing on the conversation as a television series.\nThere are a lot of movies about the art of standup and the people who do it. What made you think you could explore this in a different way?\nPaul Toogood: One of the things that became clear from all the interviews we had done was to not look at other\u2019s documentaries before making a film because it\u2019s easy to copy things or be influenced by things.\nWe made a lot of programming about the creative process \u2013 primarily through music about the world\u2019s famous songwriters and our epic film about the art of rap. We were looking for a subject whereby there were parallels in terms of a strong sense of there are certain art forms that are not afforded the praise they deserve. We felt that rap music was one of them and stand-up comedy is another. Typically the great practitioners make it look so easy that the actual act of standing up in front of an audience and speaking is terrifying to most of us mere mortals. To have a compelling narrative and credible material which you\u2019re constantly having to refresh seems to be the most noble and incredible thing. We felt they deserved a closer look. So that was our motivation.\nCertainly right from the get-go, through our interviews, from people like Jerry Seinfeld, that this is something that looks easy, but even people like Jerry Seinfeld find it impossibly difficult the first time they try to do it. In many respects it\u2019s an incredibly inspirational story which speaks to lots of things people try in their lives \u2013 things that are initially difficult that you never thing you\u2019ll be able to do it and you keep learning and finally you get there.\nLloyd Stanton: Even though we were massive fans of comedians, [we realized] how important what they do is. How they can talk about things that really get under the skin of all our lives. That\u2019s something because it\u2019s masked in laughter, there\u2019s some great truth in there. They are some of the last philosophers.\nThere\u2019s that line about how this is poetry \u2013 I had never thought of this as that before, but it\u2019s completely true.\nPaul Toogood: One of the great things that happens when you\u2019re doing something as insane as what we tried to bite off \u2013 which is essentially conduct a census from a moment in time. It\u2019s a huge amount of people \u2013 150 practitioners. What emerges is a series of patterns and themes and people hit similar marks. Very often these people have never met each other. That\u2019s how we were able to hit this narrative style where it was in conversation somebody says something and their point is backed up and progressed by the next person. After awhile, we got the sense that people talk about their truths. Generally speaking, it\u2019s only when you really start talking the truth on stage, it\u2019s when you start getting somewhere. It takes about ten years to get to this point. That\u2019s an extraordinary amount of time to devote to something before you really get anywhere. That\u2019s why we see a level of devotion in stand-up comedy fans. They really feel this guy understands something really big and important, which even scratched at the meaning of life \u2013 dare I say it.\nAs you mentioned, you reached out to many comics. I assume one person started the ball rolling. Or was this a group effort to get your interviewees?\nPaul Toogood:We started off talking to our dear old friend John Thomson in the UK, who has a background in stand-up, but is really more famous as an actor. He kept talking to us how some of the funniest stories he\u2019s ever heard were from doing stand-up nights and people discussing the worst things that have ever happened to them. We looked at the idea of doing a piece about bombing, but we felt that was a bit linear and singular. It wouldn\u2019t really do the story justice, although those parts are very funny and compelling. The way we work having made lots of films about brilliant creatives, we put together a show reel and say, \u201cThese are the kind of things we do.\u201d The artist sees these things \u2013 that they always come out looking good \u2013 that this is in praise of the art and in praise of the individual. We would then get together a number of our friends who were stand-up comedians who would come on board and help us bring four or five key cast.\nAfter awhile, there\u2019s a tipping point and also some people who ignored you the first time round get back to you because so-and-so is doing in. Once you get an Amy Schumer or a Jerry Seinfeld, everyone who ignored you figures it\u2019s a good idea to be in the film. So you just keep going. The lovely thing about it is somebody who is completely unknown could pounce in the same way a big A-list star. There are a number of people who really stand out, who perhaps aren\u2019t known to a big audience. Tiffany Haddish, who\u2019s about to be a big star as an actress, is honest and truthful and compelling in what she tells us that you can\u2019t help leaving the theater and thinking about her. Royale Watkins is stunningly open and honest in our interview, which brings me a level of interest to him. One guy ran up to us and said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m next to Jerry Lewis in your movie!\u2019 That\u2019s a wonderful surprise.\nWhen did you know you had enough people to carry this? It seems like this could go on and on.\nLloyd Stanton: We were shooting the very last interview on the last day we locked the edit. There was people and information coming in all throughout the process. We filmed for 18 months and edited for several months. During that, we were still picking up people we wanted to get. We could\u2019ve gone on indefinitely until there was a lock on. Now we have this opportunity to make a ten-part television series so the process will go on again.\nPaul Toogood: We haven\u2019t stopped, basically.\nLloyd Stanton: We were left with this incredible archives \u2013 120 plus interviews that are a minimum of an hour. You haven\u2019t used everything you\u2019ve shot. It\u2019s a strange thing. So we\u2019re now in production on the spin-off television series which will allow us to open up some of these themes \u2013 particularly the life lessons that comedians can teach us. We will be including new stand-up comedy pieces in the series.\nIs the TV series airing in the UK only? Or will I be able to see it in the States?\nLloyd Stanton: No. It\u2019s quite US-centric really. But it will be for international distribution. It\u2019ll probably turn up on a premium POD platform. It\u2019s an independent production like all of ours.\nPaul Toogood: We consciously chose, while we were working on the film, to not have stand-up performances in it so you\u2019d really concentrate on who the people were and what they were about and the work that went into it. With the series, we now get to pervert that so you get to see those comedians now through the writing process, writing something, going on to stage \u2013 whether it\u2019s still a work in development or new material. It\u2019s a slightly different, next stage to the film.\nLloyd Stanton: It\u2019ll be like a day in the life of that person \u2013 examining how they choose their material, how they develop, how they write it, and how they try it out. We might see them successfully using that material in front of a large audience.\nDYING LAUGHING is in theaters and available via VOD/ iTunes on February 24.

{"doc": {"text": "In the golden age of the worker, when worker\u2019s rights were freshly won and the unions were widely respected as groups that helped tip the scales away from the bourgeois and towards the proletariat, one of the greatest threats to the newly rejuvenated working class was automation. \u201cOne day, the robots will come and destroy everything we\u2019ve worked for in the name of profit,\u201d they would say. Instead, the robots came and made things more efficient, safer and increased productivity greatly. Then, the politicians and the upper class came and destroyed everything they worked for in the name of profit.\nIn our time, it is a pretty safe bet to say it is no longer a golden age for the worker. It is, however, seemingly a golden age for independent games. Enter Vessel, the fluid based puzzler and first game from the liberated ex-EA employees over at Strange Loop Games. Vessel approaches the automation issue from a steampunk perspective, where liquid based lifeforms called fluros have been invented by the game\u2019s protagonist, who looks a surprising amount like Bruce Campbell, M. Arkwright. These creatures have become prevalent in society, taking over the majority of factory and manual labor jobs in almost every industry. As the story progresses, you come to find out that these formerly mindless creatures have begun to evolve and pursue their own goals. In the process, they\u2019ve stopped a multitude of important machines. Ever the scientist, Arkwright decides to investigate the fluros\u2019 evolution, repair the machines and find a way to bridge the gap between humanity and the fluros.\nThis story, like many indie games, is told in a very minimalistic way. There is no dialog, really, with the protagonist\u2019s thoughts conveyed through journal entries that offer a small bit of insight into the game\u2019s world \u2013 although they mostly exist to give you a basic rundown of the various mechanics that come into play. This leaves the real story, and especially the fairly surreal ending, mostly up to your interpretation. There are times where that can be a cop out, but this is not one of those times. I always found that games, and really all forms of entertainment, that use an \u201cup to interpretation\u201d story only work when the content is strong enough to prop it up, and Vessel\u2019s certainly is.\nThe gameplay here absolutely shines. Strange Loop created their own engine from the ground up in order to handle the fairly complex fluid physics present here, and the attention to detail shines. The engine\u2019s ability to handle dynamic liquid simulation puts Vessel a sea apart from its competition. The multiple different liquids all flow, accumulate, evaporate and react in a completely logical manner. Containers can fill up, overflow and be emptied. Pretty much anything you can do with water, you need to do in Vessel to make your way through its large amount of varied, and progressively more difficult, puzzles.\nI can\u2019t put enough emphasis on how well designed those puzzles really are. Vessel is very well paced, and the way it introduces the game\u2019s concepts steadily is novel. It doesn\u2019t give you many clues as to what you should do with the knowledge it gives you, and there aren\u2019t any big red arrows or signs saying \u201cHIT THIS BUTTON\u201d or \u201cMAKE STEAM HERE\u201d so you\u2019ll have to do all the leg work yourself. Like the minimalism in the story, the minimalism in feedback given to the player works because of the way the game is made. Of course, a scientist wouldn\u2019t need, or even want, everything spelled out to him easily. He would want to experiment, document and improve on his methods to solve these problems. Vessel, and its emphasis on the player figuring out the interactions between not just fluros and the environment, but fluros and other fluros, is as close to the scientific method as we are going to see in a puzzler.\nThese interactions between the various types of fluros, as well as the various types of material they can be made out of, comprise the bulk of the problem solving. Some levels will see you needing to open up a number of doors so you can place a fluro on a button, while others will need you to find ways for two fluros of differing materials to collide so that the gas or steam they create can open up a different area. It is quite a rewarding experience when you finally do get all your little water creatures and lava creatures and \u201cYou Can\u2019t Do That on Television\u201d slime creatures to do what you need them to do.\nEven Vessel\u2019s aesthetics are exceptional. I always felt that, despite my \u201cgameplay before graphics\u201d attitude, it was the experiments with art direction indie games tend to take that really drew me to them originally. I was always a retro gamer. Even as games got more and more advanced, I still clung to my love of the 16 bit era. When the AAA console games started moving towards realism and billions of polygons, I was quite happy to find people creating 2D games still. The advancements in tech, and even in artistic ability, within the gaming industry have been so large that these 2D platformers and puzzlers end up looking just gorgeous. Vessel \u2013 with its colorful backgrounds and great lighting \u2013 is as good a looking as any indie game has ever been. The music even shines, as it features a number of pieces from well-known composer Jon Hopkins, all arranged adaptively. The music adjusts to what you are doing and it ends up adding so much to the game\u2019s feel.\nWhile this all might sound entirely perfect, I have to burst the bubble a bit. There are some issues that show that Vessel is slightly wet behind the ears, with a handful of problems that break the fluidity of the game\u2019s flow. Sorry, I\u2019m way under my quota for liquid puns here. I have to catch up or else they revoke my membership to the Shitty Pun of the Month club.\nWhile the puzzles are legitimately among the most well designed I\u2019ve seen in quite a while, the platforming elements fall a bit short. The controls aren\u2019t always as responsive as you would like, and jumping can be a bit iffy in some situations. Also, for people who aren\u2019t really used to using the brain pathways that lead to being good at puzzle games, Vessel\u2019s lack of hand holding might be a significant barrier to enjoyment. Most stages are intuitive enough that you\u2019ll figure it out, but some take a significant amount of experimenting. There are even a few that suffer from design choices, like one type of fluros that will follow you around and hit switches but is frustratingly slow, or a puzzle where you know exactly what you have to do but simply can\u2019t get the fluros to cooperate.\nCompared to the rest of the game, these problems are barely spit in the ocean of awesomeness. Vessel is easily one of, if not the best, indie games of 2012 so far. It is well designed, gorgeous to look at, and incredibly entertaining. Strange Loops has created a game that is more coheisive than most, with absolutely everything \u2013 from the graphics to the music to the puzzles \u2013 combining to put emphasis on the setting and mood. It is even a good \u2018bang for your buck\u2019 purchase as it offers you around 10 to 12 hours of squirting entertainment, which would usually cost you way more if you were looking for squirting entertainment on the internet. Hell, I was so engrossed in it I pretty much sat down and played the whole thing in a single sitting.\nI really have to pee.\nHere\u2019s the Rundown:\n+ Well paced and intelligently designed puzzles with incredibly well done physics\n+ Great to look at and listen to\n+ Long for an indie game, and well worth the money\n- Lack of hints or overt direction could turn off some gamers\n- Occasional technical issues, including a save bug that is in need of a patch\n- Some puzzles can become frustrating due to hiccups with the fluros\n8 and 8.5 represent a game that is a good experience overall. While there may be some issues that prevent it from being fantastic, these scores are for games that you feel would easily be worth a purchase.\nVessel was developed by Strange Loop games and published by Indie Loop for the PC, and eventually for the XBLA and PSN . The game was released on March 1, 2012 with an MSRP of $14.99 on the PC. XBLA and PSN release dates have not been confirmed yet.

Instead, the robots came and made things more efficient, safer and increased productivity greatly. Then, the politicians and the upper class came and destroyed everything they worked for in the name of profit.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "In our time, it is a pretty safe bet to say it is no longer a golden age for the worker. It is, however, seemingly a golden age for independent games. Enter Vessel, the fluid based puzzler and first game from the liberated ex-EA employees over at Strange Loop Games. Vessel approaches the automation issue from a steampunk perspective, where liquid based lifeforms called fluros have been invented by the game\u2019s protagonist, who looks a surprising amount like Bruce Campbell, M. Arkwright. These creatures have become prevalent in society, taking over the majority of factory and manual labor jobs in almost every industry. As the story progresses, you come to find out that these formerly mindless creatures have begun to evolve and pursue their own goals. In the process, they\u2019ve stopped a multitude of important machines. Ever the scientist, Arkwright decides to investigate the fluros\u2019 evolution, repair the machines and find a way to bridge the gap between humanity and the fluros.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "This story, like many indie games, is told in a very minimalistic way. There is no dialog, really, with the protagonist\u2019s thoughts conveyed through journal entries that offer a small bit of insight into the game\u2019s world \u2013 although they mostly exist to give you a basic rundown of the various mechanics that come into play. This leaves the real story, and especially the fairly surreal ending, mostly up to your interpretation. There are times where that can be a cop out, but this is not one of those times. I always found that games, and really all forms of entertainment, that use an \u201cup to interpretation\u201d story only work when the content is strong enough to prop it up, and Vessel\u2019s certainly is.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "The gameplay here absolutely shines. Strange Loop created their own engine from the ground up in order to handle the fairly complex fluid physics present here, and the attention to detail shines. The engine\u2019s ability to handle dynamic liquid simulation puts Vessel a sea apart from its competition. The multiple different liquids all flow, accumulate, evaporate and react in a completely logical manner. Containers can fill up, overflow and be emptied. Pretty much anything you can do with water, you need to do in Vessel to make your way through its large amount of varied, and progressively more difficult, puzzles.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "I can\u2019t put enough emphasis on how well designed those puzzles really are. Vessel is very well paced, and the way it introduces the game\u2019s concepts steadily is novel. It doesn\u2019t give you many clues as to what you should do with the knowledge it gives you, and there aren\u2019t any big red arrows or signs saying \u201cHIT THIS BUTTON\u201d or \u201cMAKE STEAM HERE\u201d so you\u2019ll have to do all the leg work yourself. Like the minimalism in the story, the minimalism in feedback given to the player works because of the way the game is made. Of course, a scientist wouldn\u2019t need, or even want, everything spelled out to him easily. He would want to experiment, document and improve on his methods to solve these problems. Vessel, and its emphasis on the player figuring out the interactions between not just fluros and the environment, but fluros and other fluros, is as close to the scientific method as we are going to see in a puzzler.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "These interactions between the various types of fluros, as well as the various types of material they can be made out of, comprise the bulk of the problem solving. Some levels will see you needing to open up a number of doors so you can place a fluro on a button, while others will need you to find ways for two fluros of differing materials to collide so that the gas or steam they create can open up a different area. It is quite a rewarding experience when you finally do get all your little water creatures and lava creatures and \u201cYou Can\u2019t Do That on Television\u201d slime creatures to do what you need them to do.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Even Vessel\u2019s aesthetics are exceptional. I always felt that, despite my \u201cgameplay before graphics\u201d attitude, it was the experiments with art direction indie games tend to take that really drew me to them originally. I was always a retro gamer. Even as games got more and more advanced, I still clung to my love of the 16 bit era. When the AAA console games started moving towards realism and billions of polygons, I was quite happy to find people creating 2D games still. The advancements in tech, and even in artistic ability, within the gaming industry have been so large that these 2D platformers and puzzlers end up looking just gorgeous. Vessel \u2013 with its colorful backgrounds and great lighting \u2013 is as good a looking as any indie game has ever been. The music even shines, as it features a number of pieces from well-known composer Jon Hopkins, all arranged adaptively. The music adjusts to what you are doing and it ends up adding so much to the game\u2019s feel.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "While this all might sound entirely perfect, I have to burst the bubble a bit. There are some issues that show that Vessel is slightly wet behind the ears, with a handful of problems that break the fluidity of the game\u2019s flow. Sorry, I\u2019m way under my quota for liquid puns here. I have to catch up or else they revoke my membership to the Shitty Pun of the Month club.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "While the puzzles are legitimately among the most well designed I\u2019ve seen in quite a while, the platforming elements fall a bit short. The controls aren\u2019t always as responsive as you would like, and jumping can be a bit iffy in some situations. Also, for people who aren\u2019t really used to using the brain pathways that lead to being good at puzzle games, Vessel\u2019s lack of hand holding might be a significant barrier to enjoyment. Most stages are intuitive enough that you\u2019ll figure it out, but some take a significant amount of experimenting. There are even a few that suffer from design choices, like one type of fluros that will follow you around and hit switches but is frustratingly slow, or a puzzle where you know exactly what you have to do but simply can\u2019t get the fluros to cooperate.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Compared to the rest of the game, these problems are barely spit in the ocean of awesomeness. Vessel is easily one of, if not the best, indie games of 2012 so far. It is well designed, gorgeous to look at, and incredibly entertaining. Strange Loops has created a game that is more coheisive than most, with absolutely everything \u2013 from the graphics to the music to the puzzles \u2013 combining to put emphasis on the setting and mood. It is even a good \u2018bang for your buck\u2019 purchase as it offers you around 10 to 12 hours of squirting entertainment, which would usually cost you way more if you were looking for squirting entertainment on the internet.

{"doc": {"text": "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Cristiano Ronaldo netted two goals and set up another to power Real Madrid's blistering attack to a 5-0 demolition of Valencia in the Spanish league on Sunday, while Atletico Madrid chipped into Barcelona's lead by maintaining its perfect record at home.\nMadrid decided the match by halftime with doubles by Ronaldo and Angel Di Maria after Gonzalo Higuain had opened the scoring.\nAtletico, meanwhile, eased to a 2-0 win over Levante despite losing striker Radamel Falcao to injury for its 11th win in 11 home games this season, breathing an inkling of life into the title chase.\nAtletico took advantage of Barcelona's first league defeat of the season the day before to reduce the gap to the pacesetters to eight points.\nMadrid's best performance, and arguably the best first half played by any team in Spain this season, of its otherwise trouble-filled league campaign left Jose Mourinho's team in third place 15 points adrift of Barcelona.\nMadrid finally resembled the side that strolled through the league last season en route to the championship with a record haul of points (100) and goals (121).\n\"We made the game easy by pressuring them hard from the start,'' said Di Maria, whose season had been subdued until Sunday's match. \"We played a great game. On a personal level, I played well and shut a few mouths.''\nMadrid had already beaten Valencia 2-0 just five days before in the first leg of their Copa del Rey quarterfinal. The two teams will meet for a third time in nine days on Wednesday in the return leg.\nValencia's collapse was complete.\nIts attack was toothless, its midfield sloppy with the ball, and its defense uncoordinated and repeatedly undone with the simplest of through passes into wide open spaces behind its back line.\nMadrid, however, was brutally efficient, quick to recover the ball and clinical in its finishing whether on the break or elaborating an attack against a set defense.\n\"They were completely superior to us,'' said Ernesto Valverde, who had guided Valencia to four wins in five league games since taking over as coach. \"Madrid has an extraordinary counterattack. Each counterattack was a clear chance for them. After the 1-0 we still weren't done, but when the 2-0 and 3-0 came so quickly we just fell apart.''\nHiguain got Madrid rolling in the ninth minute by making up for an earlier miss when he trailed Di Maria and fired his back pass beyond goalkeeper Diego Alves.\nAfter Sami Khedira had squandered a pair of clear looks on goal, Ronaldo doubled the visitors' advantage in the 35th by running onto a long pass, cutting back- first to his right, then to his left- to give Di Maria time to arrive on the far side before crossing for the winger to tap home.\nJust seconds after the restart Valencia was again retrieving the ball from its net after Madrid robbed the ball and in two passes left Ronaldo sprinting free to stab the ball between Diego Alves and his near post to make it 3-0.\nThe flurry of goals left Valencia and the fans at Mestalla stadium shell-shocked. And Madrid just kept pouring it on.\nRonaldo whipped in a vicious volley in the 41st after Mesut Oezil had deftly knocked down Di Maria's lobbed pass. And just before the halftime whistle Di Maria was inexplicably left unmarked on the break to take a pass from Oezil and casually slip the ball under the helpless Diego Alves.\nRonaldo's brace gave him 18 goals in the league, tied with Falcao. Barcelona's Lionel Messi leads the competition with 29 goals through 20 rounds.\nElsewhere, Osasuna beat visiting Deportivo La Coruna 2-1 to move off the bottom of the standings and sink its rival into last place, while forward Oscar Gonzalez scored one goal and set up another to steer mid-table Valladolid to a 2-0 home win over Real Zaragoza.\nEarlier at Vicente Calderon stadium, Adrian Lopez broke through for Atletico by capping a team buildup in the 32nd minute. Jorge \"Koke'' Resurrecion then put the result beyond doubt in the 61st, four minutes after Falcao walked off clutching the upper part of his left leg.\nAtletico coach Diego Simeone said Falcao would be sidelined for around three weeks.\nSimeone's Atletico, whose excellent season has been overshadowed by Barcelona's apparently unstoppable march toward reclaiming the domestic crown, is on a club-record run of 18 consecutive home wins in all competitions. It has also outscored its visitors 17-0 in its last six league matches.\n\"Numbers are important, but we can't pause to admire them,'' Simeone said. \"The most important thing is to keep going forward game by game until we see how far we can go.''\nOn Saturday, Barcelona fell 3-2 at Real Sociedad.

{"doc": {"text": "After a very long and demoralizing losing streak, supporters of marriage equality have recently experienced a string of victories so sudden and dramatic that it has their heads spinning. Just yesterday, the Minnesota House passed a bill that would make it the 12th state to legalize same-sex marriage. The vote came while the ink was still drying on Delaware\u2019s landmark new marriage equality law, which followed on the heels\u2014five days!\u2014of a similar milestone in Rhode Island. Up until last November, supporters had tasted defeat on 33 state-level measures.\nBut after Election Day, change was in the wind. Voters in Maine, Minnesota, Washington, and Maryland came down firmly on the side of same-sex marriage. You could credit folks like Ellen DeGeneres and NFL punter Chris Kluwe and basketball star Jason Collins\u2014and even a few die-hard Republicans such as Dick Cheney, who has come out in favor of marriage equality\u2014for helping bring about the rapid cultural shift. And no doubt that\u2019s a big part of it. But there\u2019s one force, perhaps greater than any other, that shouldn\u2019t be underestimated: the Mormon church\u2019s political surrender on gay marriage.\nIt\u2019s remarkable what has happened in the marriage fight since the Mormons decided to abandon it. Consider that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was the single biggest funder and organizer of the 2008 campaign to pass California\u2019s Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in one of America\u2019s most liberal states. The church is estimated to have directed at least $20 million to that effort, along with significant organizing clout. Documents unearthed by activist Fred Karger showed that the Mormons had 77 people working full time at the church\u2019s Salt Lake City headquarters to get Prop. 8 passed.\nThe church, in fact, had been a crucial (if not always visible) player since the 1990s, when it helped fend off efforts to legalize same-sex marriage in Hawaii and California. As far back as 1996, high-ranking LDS officials were coordinating behind the scenes and raising hundreds of thousands of dollars to orchestrate what became the first state-level vote to ban gay marriage in Hawaii. Top church officials were also heavily involved in the creation of the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), the primary player over the last decade in the fight to outlaw gay unions.\nBut after the Mormon involvement in Prop. 8 was fully exposed, the backlash was severe\u2014and apparently unexpected. The church became a target for public protests, and lost a considerable number of members who were unhappy with its involvement in a political issue that had caused individual LDS families a lot of grief. In the campaign\u2019s aftermath, a top church leader even apologized to gay church members for the pain they\u2019d suffered.\nThis is not to say that the Mormons have had a change of heart about gay marriage. The church is still adamantly opposed to it. On April 6, during the LDS\u2019s annual conference, Boyd Packer, who is next in line to assume the church\u2019s top leadership post, warned, \u201cWe need to be careful of the tolerance\ntrend trap, so that we do not get swallowed up in it. The permissiveness afforded by the weakening of the laws of the land to tolerate and legalize immorality does not reduce the serious spiritual consequence that is the result from a violation of God\u2019s law of Chastity.\u201d\nThat said, the church seems to have returned to focusing on homosexuality as a personal issue rather than a political one. After years of working behind the scenes, hiring lobbyists, and mobilizing its members to fight state referendums sympathetic to same-sex marriage, it appears to have simply dropped the rope. \u201cIn the other four states last year that had marriage, you didn\u2019t see the Mormon church anywhere,\u201d says Kevin Nix, spokesman for the LGBT advocacy group, Human Rights Campaign.\nJanet Wallis is the mother of lesbian married daughters who has been working with a group called Minnesotans United for All Families, at first to defeat an anti-gay-marriage amendment last November, and more recently to support the legislation the Minnesota House just passed. One of her daughters used to live in Utah and worked on the 2002 Olympic Committee with Mitt Romney, so she\u2019s well acquainted with the church\u2019s role in LGBT politics. During the marriage fights in Minnesota, she kept wondering where the Mormons were. Catholics have been \u201cso VERY, VERY visible\u201d during these battles, she told me via email, but \u201cthere have been no articles, no news stories, not a peep publicly re: being Mormon and how to vote.\u201d\nLast year in Maryland, the church even went so far as to squelch an effort by some Mormons to organize against a pro-marriage initiative on the state ballot. The loss of the church as an ally has been a huge blow to foes of gay marriage, especially given its ability to deploy a host of motivated volunteers. (The efficiency of the LDS church during natural disasters has been compared to that of the German Wehrmacht.)\nIf nothing else, the movement against gay marriage has lost a significant source of cash. In March, the Huffington Post reported that a scant 16 Utah residents (a rough proxy for Mormons) had donated a collective total of $1,264 to four state ballot committees fighting same-sex marriage bills. Back in 2008, more than 800 Utah residents gave $2.7 million to support Prop 8.\nKarger, the California activist who helped call attention to the church\u2019s Prop. 8 role, believes that without the Mormons\u2019 money and organizing clout, the fight has been left to a handful of extremely conservative Catholic groups such as the Knights of Columbus and NOM, none of which has much in the way of grassroots organizing skills. Indeed, a whopping 90 percent of NOM\u2019s funding comes from only about 10 individuals. According to the most recent IRS filings available, it raised nearly $3 million less in 2011 than it did in 2010, a reduction of about one-third. In 2012, according to Human Rights Campaign, gay marriage proponents in four states considering marriage bills outraised NOM by $20 million.\nWhile NOM used the specter of legalization in Rhode Island to raise money, it had a poor showing in the state. The rabidly anti-gay group Mass Resistance complained bitterly, calling NOM \u201cclueless and ineffective,\u201d and noting, \u201cNOM did no serious organizing or strategic planning. Meetings with activists would be set up, then go unattended.\u201d That\u2019s the sort of thing that would never happen if the LDS church had been on board.\n\u201cNOM has always been a shell group, the purpose of which was to funnel money from a shadowy handful of funders directed by the Mormon and Catholic hierarchy,\u201d says Evan Wolfson, the founder and president of Freedom to Marry. \u201cNow that the Mormon hierarchy seems to have pulled back, it exposes the weakness and lack of any real grassroots depth in the opposition.\u201d\nThe pullback of the LDS church may also have the unexpected effect of allowing more Republican elected officials to back marriage equality without fear of suffering at the polls. (Mormons are among the country\u2019s most reliable Republican voters.) Republicans in Rhode Island and Delaware were a key factor in marriage advocates\u2019 success, says HRC\u2019s Nix.\nWolfson is cautiously optimistic. He thinks it\u2019s too soon to know whether the LDS church has unilaterally withdrawn from the marriage fight or whether this is just a temporary cease-fire: \u201cIn 2012, part of their tactical reason for pulling back was to avoid any muddying the waters for Romney. That was a higher priority for them than even attacking gay people.\u201d\nBut it would be fair to say that the gay-marriage supporters are thrilled with the rapid about-face. \u201cIt\u2019s a new day in the fight for marriage equality, with one victory after another,\u201d Karger says. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that all these wins would not be possible if the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had not finally abandoned its 15-year battle to demonize all LGBT Americans.\u201d", "id": "<urn:uuid:7b2c3f7c-772f-420e-ae97-f85bdd506801>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2018-34", "url": "https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/05/mormons-lds-church-gay-marriage-fight/", "date": "2018-08-19T17:14:58Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2018-34/segments/1534221215261.83/warc/CC-MAIN-20180819165038-20180819185038-00240.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9740100502967834, "token_count": 1725}, "content": [{"line": "After a very long and demoralizing losing streak, supporters of marriage equality have recently experienced a string of victories so sudden and dramatic that it has their heads spinning.

The church is estimated to have directed at least $20 million to that effort, along with significant organizing clout.

{"doc": {"text": "There are two ways of raising money to support your tuition-charging school. The first is development, which is the most challenging and time-consuming, but is the most effective way to ensure sustainable revenue for your school over the long haul. The other somewhat \u201ceasier,\u201d less time-consuming, but more commonly used way \u2013 the way schools have done it for so many years \u2013 is fundraising. And although it\u2019s becoming more and more tedious while generating less and less revenue, people still do it. Why? Because that\u2019s the way they\u2019ve always done it!\nBefore progressing further, there is a reason why this happens with fundraising, and it\u2019s not \u201cthe economy,\u201d even though that\u2019s what usually gets blamed when fundraisers just done bring in what they used to. The reason is physics \u2013 The Law of Diminishing Returns. In economics, diminishing returns is the decrease in the marginal or incremental results of a process as the amount of a single effort which goes into it is incrementally increased, while all the other efforts that go into the process remain constant. In other words, more people are selling candy, and if everything else remains constant (the amount of candy sold by each person, the profit margin offered by the fundraising product provider, etc.), there\u2019s a significant possibility that the net result will be less. Then leaders don\u2019t understand what went wrong. The real reason is that in process thinking, changing one element should provide a different result, right? And it does! Unfortunately, it\u2019s usually not the expected result. If you\u2019d like to know how to combat this mindset, there are two things that must be done. If you\u2019d like to know what they are, send an email to email@example.com with the words, \u201cTwo things to improve process outcomes.\u201d\nAlso, it may help to acknowledge the other terms which have entered into the discussion between fundraising and development \u2013 namely, fund raising and advancement. You\u2019ll see there is a difference between fundraising and fund raising (it\u2019s more than just a space); \u201cfundraising\u201d will be described in this article, since \u201cfund raising\u201d is any type of activity done which generates non-programmatic revenue to support the mission of an organization. In the case of your school, and for clarity, programmatic revenue would be the tuition and fees your school charges.\nAs for advancement, our definition speaks to all the processes which are necessary to provide for your school\u2019s firm financial foundation, including asset management, retention of school families with children currently enrolled in your school, marketing to attract new students and new donors, enrollment (that is, enrolling new students in your school), and development.\nToday\u2019s article is dedicated to the difference between fundraising and development because there are a number of individuals who are engaged with schools, such as parents, board members and even administrators, who believe those two words are interchangeable.\nThey\u2019re not. They\u2019re two different constructs!\nMany consultative entities will say that you must make a fundamental shift in your strategies, moving from fundraising to development, but don\u2019t provide a timetable for successful implementation. From a consultative standpoint, the first step toward change involves analysis and recommendation. Implementation is the next step of the process, and, while many schools will fund the first step of a major transitional initiative, the next step may cost additional dollars and time which the school has not considered. Sometimes, schools acknowledge the importance of development, but then may discontinue all their fundraising without the proper guidance in place. Guess what happens? They close, because they didn\u2019t realize that fundraising has its place, and a bridge needs to be formed to successfully move from one mindset to the other. Sustainable financial support requires both strategies be utilized as the organization progresses from a fundraising mindset toward a development mindset. It\u2019s not a change (which implies a one-time, immediate event); it\u2019s a transition (which can have a very long timetable).\nThink of it as trying to turn a large luxury liner around. It\u2019s a long process. While it\u2019s pretty easy to turn a speedboat around, a luxury liner has no choice but to reverse engines to get out of port, and then, when out in wide-open waters, can begin the turnaround process in order to move forward. The same happens with moving from fundraising to development. It\u2019s a big transition\u2026both in process and in mindset.\nThe usual time frame for a successful full-blown implementation is usually three to five years, and even then, traction may only begin to happen. When you consider that a development director is expected to achieve immediate results, you can then understand why the average life-expectancy of a Development Director is\u2026ready?\u202618 MONTHS! When a new person is identified and hired, all those relationships that the prior development professional had built are severed, and they have to be rebuilt again, and, unfortunately, relationships take time to build. I\u2019ve witnessed schools which have significant development success, and when the development director leaves, the successful processes that were in place were not continued because the duties of the position were re-assigned as additional duties to another staff member. Relationships were not continued, and therefore, development revenue levels dropped, which led to the inability to assist families in need, which caused enrollment declines. If a new administration realizes that changes need to be made, it will take time to rebuild relationships and institute successful processes to bring revenue levels to the point they were in past years. Sometimes, that requires not just time, but significant time.\nUnfortunately, most school and finance boards expect instant successes. In these days of instant access to information, instant purchases of big-ticket items, and instant gratification, the expectation is that since there is a Development Director in place, monies will miraculously flow into the coffers of the school. Worse yet, the Development Director becomes the \u201ccatch-all\u201d person for Box Tops for Education, Soup Labels for Education, Scrip and all the other fundraisers (one word) the school has. It\u2019s important to realize that tasks and projects such as those are NOT the Development Director\u2019s responsibility! Yet, boards and administrators point to the \u201cOther duties as assigned\u201d clause on the job description, and regardless of whether the task is fundraising or development, it falls on the desk of the Development Director\u2026and usually to the detriment of the school.\nWhy is this? Because the Development Director is to be visible in the community, meeting with individuals and businesses. Unfortunately, most principals know how to monitor employees only when they\u2019re at work IN the building! If they\u2019re not in their offices, then people wonder what they\u2019re doing and where they are. It\u2019s a new supervisory process that many principals aren\u2019t familiar nor comfortable with.\nThen who\u2019s responsible for those fundraisers? The Parent Teacher\u2019s Guild/Organization. Fundraising is a part of your RETENTION element\u2026NOT Development, as it involves engaging the current parent community. If you\u2019d like to challenge me on that, bring it on. Show me a school that has their Development Director doing fundraising activities, and I\u2019ll show you a struggling school that can\u2019t figure out what they\u2019re doing wrong. Fundraising is still important in the transition. The danger is when short-term development expectations for significant revenue generation are not met, then the school will resort back to focusing on fundraising. The words attributed to Jack Dixon are most important to remember: \u201cIf you focus on the results, you will never change; if you focus on the change, you will see results.\u201d\nWhen Development is in place, there may be some \u201cSignature\u201d fundraising events or activities you may wish to hold on to. If it generates significant income, it becomes identified with your school, and most importantly, parents look forward to it and have a fun time with it by inviting their friends who are not a part of the school community, by all means, keep it! Remember, it\u2019s \u201cFUN\u201ddraising\u2026not \u201cTEDIOUS\u201ddraising. It\u2019s also \u201cFRIEND\u201draising,\u201d which is key to your development success (and now you see how a fundrasing event has just become a fund raising event, and potentially, a development event). It\u2019s the continued meaningful involvement of individuals with your school\u2019s mission and vision that will create it\u2019s support base.\nThe following chart offers a framework to help recognize the important differences in these two concepts:\nShort-term (planning done on a year-to-year basis)\nCandy, wrapping paper, cookie dough, popcorn, candle, fruit, wreaths, or any other kind of \u201csales\u201d\nFamily Movie Night, Roller Skating/Bowling or Dine to Donate Events\nNon-threatening to other organizations\nLong-term (planning done on a three-to-five year or five-to-ten year basis)\nTied into strategic planning, and a systemic framework of advancement\nAnnual alumni & community appeals\nPlanned Giving/Major Gifts/Bequests\nGrants, Underwriting and Sponsorships\nPartnering with community businesses\nThreatening to other organizations\nThreatening? Most school administrators don\u2019t like to be threatening. It takes boldness to be a development director, and we have the gifts of the Holy Spirit to embolden us \u2013 especially courage and fortitude! Why is fundraising non-threatening and development threatening? That\u2019s the topic of next month\u2019s article!\n\u00a9 Michael V.

Relationships were not continued, and therefore, development revenue levels dropped, which led to the inability to assist families in need, which caused enrollment declines.

{"doc": {"text": "In his SVG is for Everybody talk at An Event Apart in Seattle WA 2014, Chris Coyier walked through the current state of SVG and how Web designers and developers can use it on their sites today. Here are my notes from his talk:\n- SVG can made from essentially anything \"vector\". You can learn the syntax but you don't need to. If you can open it in Illustrator, you can save it as SVG.\n- SVG will never replace raster graphics (sets of pixels), it is good for icons, illustrations, diagrams, charts, logos, etc.\n- SVG is not new -its been around since 1999. It was designed for the Web but coverage was not great.\n- 10% of sites on the Web are using SVG according to Google.\n- To create SVG, you can hand-craft code or use a vector editing tool.\n- IE 9 does not support gradients but it does support SVG, so you can use it to create gradients in that browser.\n- SVG will resize itself to whatever space it has to fill, without loosing resolution.\n- Images set to max-width 100% will fill the size of their container and not more. With vector images, you can instead set width to 100%.\n- Inline SVG is just SVG code right inside HTML. You can set styles on each element in the markup.\n- Three big advantages to inline SVG. 1) all the elements are in the DOM so they can be styled and scripted. 2) No additional http requests are needed to load the image 3) You can define it once and reuse it again.\n- SVG templating system: sites need a system for icons. Use inline SVG and wrap elements with DEF tags, which makes sure it does not render. Then display: none on the whole SVG element.\n- From that point on, you can reference the DEFs in your SVG throughout the site. Define an object once and reuse it in many places.\n- You can set a folder of SVGs and use Grunt to create the inline code and DEFs you need for it. This is the idea of sprites for SVG\n- Unlike image sprites, SVG sprites are vector based, don't require background positioning code, can be restyled with colors, strokes, etc. (including SVG CSS controls).\n- You can control individual parts of SVG using CSS. You get some of these advantages with SVG images but not all of them.\nIcon Fonts vs. SVG\n- Both are vectors but icon fonts use anti-aliasing rules.\n- Both have CSS control but SVG has lots more: class names, target parts, SVG specific\n- Positioning of icon fonts is subject to line-heights and letter spacing. SVG is a lot easier to position.\n- Icon fonts have weird failures like CDNs/headers, IE6 supports font-face but other versions of Windows phone do not.\n- SVG has better semantics as it is just images instead of images in text/fonts.\n- Accessibility with icon fonts requires a lot of care. SVG is better as it is just an image tag.\n- Icon fonts win at support (IE6+) vs. SVG (IE9).\nDealing with Fallbacks\n- SVG needs fallback for IE 6-8 and Android 2.\n- One fallback is to show nothing. If you are using SVG for icon enhancements, you may not need them on lower end browsers.\n- Multiple background support is basically as good as SVG support so you can use them as fallbacks in background-images.\n- You should also optimize your SVG files like you optimize other Web graphics. SVG-O is a tool that can do that for you.\nSVG also supports animations, filters (including CSS filters), and more.

Moses responds to the all-too-human inclination to forget the Lord, to overlook His redemptive works in our life, to neglect His offer of mercy and disregard God altogether.\nThat we, too, might remain mindful, Jesus gives us the great memorial of the Eucharist. And just as God guided the Israelites in the desert, so He guides our memory as we make our way to Him in the Eucharist. He does this in three ways:\nThe Eucharist responds to the human experience of hunger. God allowed the Israelites to \u201cbe a afflicted with hunger\u201d in their desert wandering. But He does so in order to feed them Himself, with the miraculous food of manna, and to persuade them that \u201cman does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.\u201d That is to say, thanks to divine Providence, the experience of hunger leads us back to God.\nHunger makes us cherish what really matters most in life\u2014 the Word of God. It rekindles our commitment to rely on God to provide what we need to make it through our own vast and terrible deserts, our own struggles with slavery. Hunger reminds us that the craving of our bodies is satisfied only by the human body of Jesus\u2014the Word that proceeds from His mouth, offering us His flesh as food: \u201cHe who feeds on my flesh &hellips; has life eternal.\u201d\nHunger, then, tests our intention to keep God's commandments, which is the surest sign of our love for Jesus (Jn 14, 21).

The crowd quarrels: \u201cHow can He give us His flesh to eat?\u201d But as we live by faith, we experience how the efficacy of the Eucharist transforms contradiction into grace-filled affirmation.

{"doc": {"text": "Next year at fall break I'll be thinking, What did we do last year?\nThen I'll remember that fall break was basically three days of doing nothing, coming to the realization on Tuesday morning that I had a ton of stuff to do, and then a blur of work.\nI had some vague idea of working ahead so that my future weekends wouldn't be so swamped, but that didn't happen. I did get my lesson plan templates set up for the rest of the academic year, though, which was tedious but will make my life easier going forward.

{"doc": {"text": "As of late, my 5 year old LG Flatron L1752S LCD monitor has been acting strangely. The screen flickers (most noticeable if you pay attention to text on any window) when I scroll down webpages or watch video. It's impossible to play games because of the constant black screens that plague my game-time and it takes longer than usual for the screen to return to full brightness after a full-screen app, such as Far Cry 3, has been closed. And once it has returned to normal, the colors look over-saturated and it really becomes hard for me to look at the screen after a while. Now, the first thing that came to my mind was that my GPU was at fault. I re-installed the driver to my AMD Radeon HD 5770, checked its temperature and fan speed at both idle and running states and found them all to be in perfect order. I also made sure of its cables, if they were firmly in place or not. I did the above with my Core 2 Quad and again, found nothing out of the ordinary. [Details on the GPU] GPU temperature at idle: 40 C GPU temperature while running Far Cry 3 at Near Ultra settings: 64-67 C Fan speed at idle: 35 % Fan speed while running Far Cry 3: 50 % (this ruled out fan clogging due to dust) Monitor refresh rate set to: 75 Hz (Changing to 60 Hz didn't help) [A little more detail on the black screen issue] The black screens come at random. Games run fine for the first 5 minutes, after which the black screens come and go erratically. While the screen stays black, sound, movement and everything else stay unaffected. After about 10 minutes, the black screen issue becomes frequent enough to force me to close whatever game I'm playing (Sleeping Dogs, Hitman: Absolution, Far Cry 3). Also, the black screens come at a lesser rate if I stay still or stare at the sky (this made me assume that my GPU is dying, but evidence says otherwise!). Bringing everything down to low and changing the resolution to 800X600 didn't help. [What I haven't done yet] I haven't tried a different monitor yet. I plan to do so in a few hours.

{"doc": {"text": "This lively rock musical of the final days of Jesus Christ is a supercharged rendition of a superstar. The idea of putting His life on the stage and screen in this manner was and continues to be offensive to some people. To others, however, it is exactly what needs to be done with the story of Jesus. We need to have people see and feel the electricity of this spiritual story.\nThe movie is shot on location in Israel and benefits substantially from the wonderful natural rock formations in the desert as well as the ancient Roman ruins that are used as backdrops for the film.\nThe opening scene shows us a group of actors arriving on location and getting into their costumes and the final scene is of these same persons getting back on the bus and leaving.\nThree key characters dominate the movie and sing most of the songs. They are Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Judas. Mary is portrayed loving and accepting---she has been powerfully changed by Jesus' message even though she doesn't fully understand why. Judas is doubting, cautious, scared, and accusatory---he wants to believe but feels Jesus should pay more attention to Judas' warnings. It is only at the end, after he has already betrayed Jesus, that he realizes how much he loves him. At this point he sings the song that Mary sang earlier in the film about loving Jesus but not understanding why.\nAlthough we know the ending and that this movie is about very important spiritual issues and ultimately about pain, suffering and death; it is told in an exciting, joyful manner through the vibrant music. Another wonderful touch is the scene where Jesus is taken before Herod. All of a sudden the music is no longer with a rock beat. Instead it is ragtime and the scene is played for laughs. It is a way of reminding us all that we must nourish our lightness, our sense of humor is essential if we are going to get through the darkest of moments.\nMusic is one of the most important ways that humans can get in touch with their spiritual dimension. This musical helps to do just that and more. By balancing Judas and Mary in the script, it is also helping you see the importance of overcoming your resistance to change and the need to let go and change even when you don't quite understand what is happening to you. Not all things are explainable. Sometimes you have to act on faith.\nClearly the story of Jesus Christ is worth singing about. We have written a thousand hymns in his honor to glorify God. The idea of putting the story into the rock idiom helps us more fully appreciate the idea of remembrance of Him through breaking of bread, His body, and drinking of wine, His blood. We need to build spirituality into our everyday lives. We need habits and rituals to assist us in not forgetting to value our spirit, to nurture that spirit, to love that dimension of what being human is all about.\nI also like the movie as it is a way of saying that each and every one of us can build God and spiritual dimensions into our profession lives just as these musicians and artists have done in their creation of this movie.

{"doc": {"text": "Advertise Lake Vacation Rentals\nWinchester Lake is nestled in the heart of northwestern Connecticut's elegant Litchfield County. At 229 acres, the crystal clear water of the lake offers visitors and residents plenty of opportunity for fishing and boating. Although the forested shoreline is fairly developed with private homes, visitors can gain access to the awaiting water through a public boat launch on the southern shore adjacent to the Winchester Lake dam.\nWinchester Lake is a manmade lake created by a dam on the headwaters of the East Branch Naugatuck River completed in the late 1920s. The lake averages nine feet deep with a maximum depth of 17 feet. Most of the deep water is in the southern end of the lake near the dam. The northern end of the lake is fairly shallow. Rather than cut the trees in the area when the dam was first constructed, engineers allowed the forest to flood and later cut the tree tops during winter ice. Today submerged trees and stumps abound throughout the lake. Although a bit of an obstacle course for boaters, the lake is known for its largemouth bass and northern pike. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection began stocking northern pike into the lake in 2005. Anglers are now reporting pike exceeding the state's 26-inch size limit, with many of these fish reaching 36 inches. The dam is a popular spot for fishing, but anglers should use heavy line to deal with the numerous underwater snags. Note: Although most fish taken from Connecticut lakes and streams are safe to eat, refer to the Connecticut Fish Consumption Advisory (link below) before eating fish caught from any Connecticut waterway.\nWinchester Lake's beautiful setting, varied shoreline and rocky coves make if a favorite destination for boaters and paddlers. An eight MPH limit on motorboats keeps the water calm and peaceful. Due to the abundance of submerged trees, flat bottom boats, canoes and kayaks will have the easiest passage across the lake. For those who would like to spend some time in the area, vacation rentals and private real estate are abundant as well as additional lodging in the nearby city of Winsted.\nCampers will find several private campgrounds near Burr Pond State Park, southeast of Winchester Lake. Camping is also available in the American Legion State Forest located east of Winchester Lake.\nFor additional outdoor recreation, Dennis Hill State Park is located northwest of Winchester Lake. This 240-acre park offers picnic facilities, hiking, and spectacular panoramic views as far away as New Hampshire. The Mad River Reservoir and Rugg Brook Reservoir are located northeast of Highland Lake and offer wildlife viewing and hiking. Southeast of Winchester Lake is Paugnut State Forest and Sunny Brook State Forest. Paugnut State Forest is part of a 2,410 acre, contiguous park and forest complex that includes Burr Pond State Park and Sunny Brook State Park. Popular activities include hiking, mountain biking, hunting and cross country skiing. Burr Pond State Park is a great place to spend a summer afternoon. Burr Pond offers fishing, boating and swimming and the surrounding area is great for hiking.\nEast of Winchester Lake is the American Legion and Peoples State Forests. These two forests offer camping, mountain biking, hiking, hunting, picnic facilities, cross-country skiing, and snowmobiling trails. The West Branch of the Farmington River, designated as a Wild and Scenic River by the National Park Service, is the focal point of the heavily forested land and offers river-based recreational activities including trout fishing, canoeing, kayaking and tubing. East of Winchester Lake is Crystal Lake, a primary source of drinking water for the town of Winchester. The 145-acre sparking lake is also known for its boating and excellent trout fishing. Highland Lake, located just a few miles east of Crystal Lake is a 444-acre sparkling lake known for its bass, salmon and trout.\nThe city of Winsted, located within the town Winchester, lies east of Winchester Lake. The town is noted for its stately Victorian, Greek Revival, Neo-Classical, Ecclesiastical, Queen Anne and Colonial Revival homes. The Main Street area is lined with unique shops and restaurants. For children there is a skateboard park, a huge Playscape park, ball fields, and miniature golf with batting cages and go carts. Golfers will find a several golf courses in the area. Winsted also provides the area with complete shopping facilities\nLess than a half hour south is the City of Torrington, the largest city in Litchfield County. Visitors to Winchester Lake will find Torrington to be a mix of retail and tourist attractions. The downtown area is as a thriving cultural center, boasting the Warner Theatre and the renowned Nutmeg Conservatory. Antique dealers, art galleries, art deco architecture and small specialty shops make the area appealing for residents and tourists alike. There are also a number of city parks and hiking trails that allow visitors to truly enjoy the beauty of the area.\nNo matter what your reason for visiting Winchester Lake, you are sure to be treated to scenic views and beautiful inviting water.

{"doc": {"text": "Surefire Health Tips to\nTransition to Autumn\n\u0119Deborah Barr, 2011-16; all rights reserved.\nThe Autumn Equinox provides a tremendous\noutpouring of energy for your use or misuse. Your\nthoughts, feelings, words, choices and actions can create\ngreater health and an abundance of all good things if you are\nconsciously directing them toward what you DO want--right NOW.\nEquinoxes represent balance and autumn is harvest time. What\nseeds have you planted in the spring? What were your dominant\nmental seeds? How healthy have your food choices been? You\nwill most likely reap the results of your efforts of the past\ntwo seasons to fulfill your goals, vision and dreams. Does that\nscare you or excite you? Either way, it's never too late for a\nfresh, new approach to taking control of your health and\npersonal life. Autumn represents letting go. Are you\nready to release all that's been intensifying your challenges\nand keeping you stuck?\nEating and living in harmony with the seasons is one aspect of\nmy Holistic WholeHealth approach to creating radiant\nhealth and energy; a healthy fit body and mind; emotional\nharmony and an abundant, joyful life you love. Many of the\nreductionist and one-size-fits-all methods of western medicine\nand many alternative models are inadequate in assisting you\nwith complete recovery from physical and emotional health\ndistress and personal crises.\nThere is a more accurate Holistic method for you to determine\nwhat is needed for healing your emotional, physical\nand lifestyle problems. My WholeHealth approach is based\non centuries old traditional health wisdom founded on solid\nprinciples rather than popular trends that contradict each other\nand fade in time. I have several offerings that can benefit you\nand details are at the end of this article.\nHealth Challenges \u2013 Lungs, Immunity, Digestion and Skin\nEach season brings the potential for specific physical and\nemotional health issues. If your health is weak you are more\nlikely to experience health challenges during the transition\nfrom summer to autumn. The well being of your body, mind and\nemotions in any season is dependent, to a large extent, on your\nfood and lifestyle choices of the previous seasons.\nAccording to the centuries old wisdom of traditional health\nphilosophies, autumn impacts the lungs and large intestine.\nColds, sinus problems, lung and immune ailments (including\nallergies and asthma), digestive problems, skin conditions,\nweakness and/or pain in the arms, thumbs and index fingers; weak\nabdominal muscles; and pain and/or weakness in the thumb and\nindex fingers are some common imbalances related to lung and\ndigestive health and prevalent during this season.\nthere is disharmony in these organs, specific emotions and\ncharacteristics will be more pronounced. Perhaps during this\ntime of year you\u2019ve noticed that you become indecisive,\nlethargic, depressed, or unable to see positive solutions and\nmove beyond adversity. Or you may engage in self-blame and\nnot-good-enough syndrome; become unresponsive, indifferent,\nnegative, ineffective, isolated, self-destructive, and overly\nself-protective. These symptoms are caused by lung and large\nintestine imbalances, and originate from poor diet, excessive or\ninsufficient activity, climate, and/or organ malfunction.\nAnxiety, depression, and other emotional disharmonies will be\ncovered in great detail in my upcoming\nEmotional Harmony Webinar.\nSubscribe to free e-newsletter, Whole Health\nMatters, for details.\nMost dry conditions are exacerbated during this season\nand are related to the lungs\u2014dry skin and throat, itchiness and\nmost skin conditions, chapped lips, and excessive thirst. Even\nmore common are conditions caused by an excess of mucus forming\nfluids. This creates problems in the lungs by inhibiting the\nexchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. When too much moisture or\nmucus collects in the lungs, these gases cannot pass freely.\nFruit and cow\u2019s milk products, including cheese, yogurt, and ice\ncream, cause a lot of mucus in the respiratory system even if\nthey are labeled low-fat. Too much mucus in the lung tissues\nmakes them susceptible to inflammation and hypersensitive to the\neffects of irritants in the air. Mucus traps harmful pollutants\nallowing them to accumulate rather than be excreted. Phlegm in\nthe lungs is often caused by weak digestion. Each person\u2019s\nhealth plan should be individualized; however, some general\nguidelines are listed below.\nTherapeutic Foods for Autumn Health\nhelp clear mucus in the lungs and intestines. They\ninclude onions, garlic, turnip, broccoli, celery, ginger,\ncabbage, horseradish, radish, daikon, small amounts of hot\npeppers and chilies, seaweeds, and ground flaxseed. Use several\nof these every day.\nPungent cooking herbs include garlic, ginger, black\npepper, basil, fennel, cinnamon, cloves, marjoram, rosemary,\ncaraway, dill and bay leaf. The rich beta-carotene content of\ngolden-orange and dark green vegetables helps protect these\norgans. They include carrot, winter squash, broccoli, parsley,\nkale, mustard greens, and watercress.\nfoods help to cleanse the colon and lungs and whole, unprocessed\ngrains are the best source, including brown rice, barley,\nquinoa, oats, and millet. Eat 2 cups or more daily.\ndry conditions such as dry\ncough, dry skin, itchiness, excessive thirst, and sluggish\nbowels or constipation, emphasize these foods: seaweed, peaches,\npears, apples (best to cook fruit in the autumn and winter),\nstring beans, tofu, tempeh, brown rice syrup, black sesame\nseeds, ground flaxseed, organic butter or ghee, organic eggs,\noysters, and clams.\nbitter, spicy, and sour foods and eliminate dehydrating\nsubstances such as coffee, alcohol and cigarettes.\n3-5 day cleansing diet of simple, easy to digest foods\ncan help bring you back to balance. Eat only whole, unprocessed\ngrains, steamed vegetables and\nSoup. Start the day with warm lemon water\nand drink plenty of liquids including water and herbal teas.\nChew well to alkalize the food, sit down and eat in a relaxed\nway, and avoid eating after 6 p.m.\nFoods in the lotus family are beneficial for lung health\nand other conditions.\nabout this little known food group and its uses.\nYou can give your lungs and immune system a boost by\nincorporating medicinal mushrooms both as a food and in\nsupplement form. Learn which ones are best for you.\nThere are many safe and effective herbs that can clear lung,\ndigestive, skin, and all conditions without the negative side\neffects of pharmaceuticals. Some herbal remedies\nare described. There are others not listed since\nit\u2019s best to consult with a professional herbalist to determine\nthe best remedies for your constitution and condition. If you\nhave chronic problems, you'll save money, time and trail and\nerror with a\nprofessional consultation so that\nrecommendations can be customized for your entire health.\nExercise and activities that promote higher oxygen levels in the\nblood will make you feel more energetic, alert and positive.\nRaising oxygen levels also allows the brain to function better\nand promotes a positive mental outlook.

For the purpose of this website a highrise is considered to be a building of at least 12 storeys or a multi-floored building at least 35 meters tall. For the sake of convenience highrise buildings are also referred to as skyscrapers (we don't set a minimum height for a skyscraper other than it must be a highrise building).\nConstruction Status Definitions\nBuilt - Structure currently exists. Construction is complete and structure has potential for use. Structures undergoing renovation remain in this category.\nUnder-Construction - Structure is currently under-construction. Structural components are being assembled permanently on-site. Excavation doesn't count as construction.\nProposed - Structure is planned to be built and construction hasn't yet begun.

Why is this?\nThis could be for a number of reasons:\nOur editors may not yet have identified and marked every building in the city.

Some multi-floored buildings which are visible on the satellite photos but aren't marked may not be considered as a highrise. For example, a 10 storey residential building (with a height of below 35 meters) is not considered a highrise and will not be marked on the map. In the image to the right, the lower building, while casting a large shadow, is not marked as a highrise because it has only 10 floors, while the building across the street from it, which has 13 floors, is marked. Also, structures such as Toronto's CN Tower or Seattle's Space Needle, while certainly being quite tall, aren't marked because they aren't considered as highrises. The maps may be expanded in the future to include additional types of structures.\nThe building may be outside of the city boundary.\nThe building may simply not exist in the SkyscraperPage database at all.\nSome buildings appear to be marked in the wrong location. Why is this?\nTall buildings on the map are marked at the position where they rise from the ground. Sometimes satellite imagery of a city shows buildings from an oblique (angled) view and a building may appear offset from its actual map location.\nIn the image to the right, the red marker is marking the tower which rises to the right of it, not the tower with the roof the marker is over top of.

{"doc": {"text": "How To Choose A Wheelchair\nNowadays, wheelchairs can be cheap to purchase and are widely available, so choosing a wheelchair can be confusing. Some people will have been prescribed a specific sort of wheelchair by an Occupational Therapist whilst others might want a wheelchair for when an elderly relative comes to stay.\nSomebody using the wheelchair independently will require a self propelling (large wheels) model they push themselves. A self propelled, or transit wheelchair (smaller wheels) will be appropriate if the wheelchair will be pushed by an attendant.\nA folding wheelchair is a good choice for occasional use as they can easily be dismantled, folded and transported by car. The rear wheels will usually come off, and the back might fold down to save space. These wheelchairs are ideal for those going out for the day in the car, or perhaps for someone who can't walk as far as they once could, but maybe don't need to be in a wheelchair all the time. A dedicated motor can be purchased to turn the manual wheelchair into an attendant controlled powerchair making hills much less of a problem. If you are looking at a wheelchair for occasional use, the lighter it is, the easier it will be to dismantle and put in a car boot. As a very rough guide, folding wheelchairs weigh around 33-44lbs / 15-20Kg, which doesn't sound too heavy, but remember that somebody will be pushing wheelchair, and perhaps getting it in and out of the car.\nFolding wheelchairs are available in various sizes, but often do not offer the specialised features that a prescribed wheelchair can offer. For others, the wheelchair will be used more often, perhaps all day, at work, or indoors, for example. For this sort of wheelchair user, the comfort and manoeuvrability is likely to be much more important than how much the wheelchair costs. These wheelchairs are less likely to be folding models, as the performance and weight of the wheelchair is more important than whether it folds. These rigid, self propelled wheelchairs combine a lighter frame and wheels. They might have a more specialised back, seat cushion, foot rests and arm rests.\nWheelchair users who lead an active lifestyle, which might include playing sports such as tennis and basketball as well as driving and day to day living, will require a different sort of wheel chair again. These users are likely to move away from a cumbersome folding wheelchair, to one that is very lightweight, smaller and stronger than a traditional wheelchair. A sport wheelchair might even be constructed from titanium which is stronger and lighter than aluminium. It probably won't have traditional style foot rests, as these will be incorporated into the frame. It might not have arm rests or handles, as it won't need to be pushed. It is also likely to have customisable front and rear wheels so that the user has the most appropriate wheels and tyres for their needs. The wheels on some rigid wheelchairs can be pushed inwards so that they lean towards the user to provide more responsiveness. The highly adjustable and customisable nature of these wheelchairs means that the user might only needs one wheelchair for all activities - day to day living and sports. These lightweight chairs are easy to put in a car, and the wheelchair user can put their wheelchair in the car from the driver's seat. This means that they don't have to rely on others, and can maintain their independence. These very lightweight wheelchairs are utilising a lot of technology and techniques from mountain bike manufacturers. Indeed, some of these rigid wheelchairs resemble a mountain bike more than a traditional wheelchair, and depending on the model and specifications may only weigh 15-17lbs / 8Kg.\nThe efficiency of a wheelchair can be measured easily in a non-scientific way. The user can simply see how far they move in a given wheelchair, on a given surface in just one push. Because of the number of joints, and weight of the steel of aluminium, a folding wheelchair loses a lot of energy, so a folding wheelchair won't move as far as a rigid wheelchair per push. A titanium sport wheelchair weighs roughly a third of the weight of a standard steel folding wheelchair, and so will move much further per push. This is an important consideration when choosing a wheelchair.\nThe process of choosing a wheelchair can be complicated. The wheelchair manufacturers make this easier by providing a prescription form for some models. This is a step by step method of choosing the right wheelchair, based on the user's condition, daily activities and any other special requirements. Depending on the complexity of the user's requirements, the wheelchair manufacturer may offer the service of a trained expert to help with the prescription. All sorts of situations are considered from whether the user needs to cross roads, to the size and width of the front castors.\nWhatever style of wheelchair you choose, a wheelchair cushion will be recommende", "id": "<urn:uuid:2de9d9e1-1127-4271-b081-40454065421c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2018-34", "url": "http://www.disabledinfo.co.uk/dis/77-how-to-choose-a-wheelchair.asp", "date": "2018-08-17T22:42:03Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2018-34/segments/1534221213158.51/warc/CC-MAIN-20180817221817-20180818001817-00080.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.968385636806488, "token_count": 982}, "content": [{"line": "How To Choose A Wheelchair", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Nowadays, wheelchairs can be cheap to purchase and are widely available, so choosing a wheelchair can be confusing.

{"doc": {"text": "Twenty Eleven is the default theme for WordPress in 2011. There are tons of really cool improvements and features packed into it \u2014 more Post Formats, beautiful new header images, alternate color schemes and layouts, even custom link colors. All those features add up to the best part of Twenty Eleven: just how customizable it is. It looks great as a blog, a showcase of all your posts, and even a tumblelog or photolog.\nTwenty Eleven features seven Post Formats that help the look of your blog posts better match what you\u2019re publishing. Alongside the Standard Format (for traditional blog posts and longer articles) are six additional Formats; Aside, Link, Gallery, Status, Quote, Video, and Image.\nThe Aside Format is for shorter posts of about 1 paragraph. Because they\u2019re shorter and meant to be digested quickly the title of the Aside post is hidden on Index pages.\nThe Link Format looks a lot like the Aside post but if you\u2019re using the Twenty Eleven Ephemera Widget to display a list of your recent Aside and Link posts (found in Appearance \u2192 Widgets) the title of your Link posts will point to the URL of the first link in your post instead of pointing back to the post on your blog.\nThe Gallery Format is meant for posts using the Gallery shortcode. Gallery posts will show a thumbnail from your galleries on Index pages.\nThe Status Format is for short personal updates. Each Status post will show the avatar of the post author alongside the content.\nIf you have a post that\u2019s almost entirely a quote, the Quote Format will make those quotes stand out.\nThe Video Format is meant for posting a single video, which will appear with minimal post meta above the post to help your video content shine.\nThe Image Format is meant for posting one image and one image only. Here the post meta, seen below your post, is presented more like a caption for the post.\nLight or Dark Color Schemes\nWith only one click Twenty Eleven will allow you to change your blog\u2019s color scheme from light to dark. You can find the color scheme options in Appearance \u2192 Theme Options.\nCustom Link Colors\nFrom Appearance \u2192 Theme Options you can also change your blog\u2019s link color to better suit your current color scheme and style.\nThe Twenty Eleven theme features three default layouts for your blog. Two of those layouts feature a typical sidebar, either on the left or right of your content. The third layout does away with the sidebar altogether turning Twenty Eleven into a tumblelog theme. It\u2019s perfect for turning your blog into a photolog.\nIn addition to the default layouts Twenty Eleven also features 2 custom page templates. Either one will take a normal WordPress page and transform the layout. The Sidebar page template is the simpler of the two. It simply adds a sidebar to your page. The Showcase page has more features.\nTo get started with the custom Showcase Page Template you need to create a page for it. Choose the Showcase Template under page templates in any page, save it, and assign it as the front page in Settings \u2192 Reading. This will change your site from the standard Twenty Eleven blog look to Twenty Eleven\u2019s fancy showcase. You still have you regular blog list at hand for several views, like categories, searches, and tags and you can specify another page to work as your blog if you want to.\nTo add posts to the Featured Post section, also known as a post slider, just mark some posts as sticky. That\u2019s all there is to it.\nTo have a big featured image you need to use an image that is at least as big as the header image (1000px x 288px). Also, make sure you have a set size for Large image under Settings \u2192 Media that allows for such sizes.\nTo populate the sidebars Ephemera Widget you can make use of the Aside or Link post formats when you create a new entry (or convert an old one).\nAnd if you want an introductory text message, just write it in the content of your Showcase page and it will appear on your site. And that\u2019s it!\nThere\u2019s one more layout feature. The Twenty Eleven layout responds and adapts to your browser window. If your visitors are on a mobile device, Twenty Eleven will respond with a custom mobile layout. You can give this feature a go right now just by resizing your browser window on the Twenty Eleven demo site.\nYou can also dress up your posts by pulling images or blockquotes into the margins with a class of \u201cpull\u201d and \u201calignleft\u201d or \u201calignright\u201d. With blockquotes you can also add a class of just \u201cpull\u201d if you want a more dynamic blockquote that extends out on both sides. Here are some examples of how to do that in the post HTML editor.\n<blockquote>A normal blockquote</blockquote> <blockquote class=\"pull\">A bolder blockquote that extends into both margins</blockquote> <blockquote class=\"pull alignleft\">A bolder blockquote that floats into the left margin</blockquote> <blockquote class=\"pull alignright\">A bolder blockquote that floats into the right margin</blockquote>\nAdding a \u201cpull\u201d class to your left and right floated images will pull them into the margins as well.\nQuick Specs (all measurements in pixels)\n- The maximum content width is\n- The maximum sidebar width is\n- The header image is\n- The maximum width for images on attachment pages is", "id": "<urn:uuid:a8ac7f6a-db7e-4844-a8b2-0125a0eec090>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2015-14", "url": "https://theme.wordpress.com/themes/twentyeleven/?like=1&source=post_flair&_wpnonce=9b0b44395e", "date": "2015-03-29T10:40:26Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-14/segments/1427131298464.94/warc/CC-MAIN-20150323172138-00196-ip-10-168-14-71.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.8649402260780334, "token_count": 1161}, "content": [{"line": "Twenty Eleven is the default theme for WordPress in 2011.

{"doc": {"text": "Posted by champ83 on 1/27/2012 11:23:00 AM (view original):\nI like the concept of being a passing team and switch to run if pass isn't working (i.e. defense is playing Pass defense), and vice versa.\nI would like to see consideration of additional changes as follows:\n1. set defense coverage in Man-to-man (either aggressive press coverage, or conservative off line of scrimmae; CBs are key defenders), or zone coverage (CBs, S, LBs all factor in coverage)\n2. set defense blitz level/type (basic blitz = 1 blitzer, multiple blitz = 2 blitzers, max blitz = 3 blitzers, also have a zone blitz)\n2a. set offensive blitz protection to either basic (no extra protection), moderate (TE/RB chip blocks, they go out for pass if not a heavy blitz), or max protection (TE/RB stay in to block and don't go out for pass)\n3. set defense line style to 1-gap (Defense needs better DL than LBs... DTs try to make plays, LBs have to fend of blocks) or 2-gap (Defense needs better LBs than DL... DTs occupy OL and don't make plays but LBs have free run and make the plays), you can recruit DL/LB to fit your style\n4. set O-line blocking to Zone blocking (OL requires BLK, GI, and Tech) or Man-to-man blocking (OL require BLK and Str), you can recruit OL to fit your style\n5. Offense can call individual plays, by setting a percentage of times they can each be used. Maybe have an inventory of 10 to 15 basic offensive plays. (For example, if there were 10 plays, a SIM team might set all of them to 10% each and run them equally). Called pass plays would determine the primary receiver, if he is covered and QB decides not to throw, it's as if current system is in place and QB makes another pass or scramble. Play-by-play results would need to identify play that was called (ex: \"QB incomplete pass to WR on skinny post\", \"RB rushes for 4 yards on draw\"), so defense could scout as if watching the plays on film.\nExample of play inventory would be:\nRB screen (more effective if defense is rushing the passer),\nBubble screen to WR (more effective when the defense playing off line of scrimmage or CB is poor tackler),\nCrossing pattern (more effective when DB/LB doesn't have GI to pick up in zone or DB doesn't have Speed to follow WR in man-to-man),\nDeep vertical \"go\" routes (more effective when WR has speed and/or DB doesn't),\nStop-and-go, Sluggos/slant-and-go, Out-and-up (WR needs Tech and Speed),\nOut/sideline patterns,can be deep or short (WR needs Tech to get feet in bounds, these also stop clock in hurry-up mode),\nPost/skinny post patterns (up to Safety to make play on WR),\nCurl routes/come-back/slant routes for possession receivers with little Speed/Elus but good hands,\nDraw to RB (more effective if defense is rushing the passer),\nZone read runs (either QB/RB carries, depending if Aggr run defense and DE charges then QB keeps, if Consv defense and thus DE slow plays then the QB hands off to RB),\nBasic RB inside runs (DTs and MLB defend) and outside runs (DE and OLB defend).\nQB draw (effective with running QB and/or blitzing defense)\nQB roll-outs (pass or run depending on GI and play available)\nI think this is my favorite ideas post - great stuff champ83.\nAs for #3) isn't the 4-3 supposed to be a 1-gap and the 3-4 supposed to be a 2-gap??? And if that is the case, it would sure be nice if the game engine took into account the different abilities required of the D-line and linebackers in both cases. Tailoring your O-line to either zone-blockers or man-blockers would also give an alternative to everyone gunning for just BLK-STR O-linemen. Athletic linemen with GI and TQ who had lower strength would then be sought after as well.\nA big problem with right now is that basically everyone is forced to recruit for the same strong cores in all the positions. It would make it a lot more interesting if the Cores at each position was more dependent on your style of offense and defense rather than just being generic as they are now.\nFor example, a WR out of WB or ND-Box sets (think Georgia Tech) wouldn't need great GI or TQ or even Elusiveness to a great degree but would certainly need Speed, Hands, Strength and blocking ability. A shotgun system would require WR's with a lot more GI and TQ and ELU, but maybe wouldn't ALL need as much speed or strength or any blocking to speak of.\nTHis would make recruiting way more interesting without you having to change the recruiting programming at all.", "id": "<urn:uuid:4c1310dc-39b1-471a-8eaa-c7d28af509ea>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2016-30", "url": "https://www.whatifsports.com/forums/Posts.aspx?topicID=450532&page=25&TopicsTimeframe=30", "date": "2016-07-30T11:19:16Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-30/segments/1469257836397.31/warc/CC-MAIN-20160723071036-00251-ip-10-185-27-174.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.965960681438446, "token_count": 1093}, "content": [{"line": "Posted by champ83 on 1/27/2012 11:23:00 AM (view original):", "label": "date without context", "split": false}, {"line": "I like the concept of being a passing team and switch to run if pass isn't working (i.e. defense is playing Pass defense), and vice versa.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "I would like to see consideration of additional changes as follows:", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "1. set defense coverage in Man-to-man (either aggressive press coverage, or conservative off line of scrimmae; CBs are key defenders), or zone coverage (CBs, S, LBs all factor in coverage)", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "2. set defense blitz level/type (basic blitz = 1 blitzer, multiple blitz = 2 blitzers, max blitz = 3 blitzers, also have a zone blitz)", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "2a. set offensive blitz protection to either basic (no extra protection), moderate (TE/RB chip blocks, they go out for pass if not a heavy blitz), or max protection (TE/RB stay in to block and don't go out for pass)", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "3. set defense line style to 1-gap (Defense needs better DL than LBs...

In the midst of a 5-day heat wave here in NYC, not ideal conditions for spray painting up on the roof.

(This stuff won't cure in high humidity) There was simply no way I was going to be able to hand paint the eye and logo to my satisfaction, so I came up with the idea to print out to scale on inkjet sticker labels.

{"doc": {"text": "The final stupid weekend of what was an extremely stupid NFL regular season. I mean, they're all pretty stupid, but this one certainly felt more stupid than usual. Bad calls, bad coaching, bad penalties. Just stupidity all around. Let's summarize for Week 17\u2026\nThe second stupidest officiating moment, Bill Leavy edition\nWith playoff implications in play, Leavy's crew had a rough go in the late moments of the Chiefs-Chargers game. The first example wasn't necessarily a bad call, but it was still poor officiating because Leavy's crew didn't perform their due diligence.\nDeep in their own territory, the Chargers snapped it to Eric Weddle on a fake punt on 4th-and-2. Weddle apparently gained the first down before he fumbled, leading to a Kansas City touchdown. It was ruled by Leavy's crew, though, that his forward progress was stopped before he coughed it up. Again, might have been the right call on a bang-bang play, but why wasn't first-down yardage reviewed? And why was no explanation given? This was a play that had major implications and merited an extra look, but Leavy and Co. ignored all of the options put in place for them to get these calls right.\nThe stupidest officiating moment, Bill Leavy edition\nBut that game might not have even gone to overtime had Leavy's crew noticed that the Chargers had an illegal formation with seven men on one side of the ball when Ryan Succop missed what would have been the game-winning field goal late in the fourth quarter.\nThe worst part of this: Two officials\u2014who appear from the tape to be side judge Keith Parham and umpire Ruben Fowler\u2014were staring straight at the line from behind the Chargers rushers before the snap of the ball. They had to see the seven Chargers on the line to the right of the ball, which is illegal. Teams can have only six men on either side of the ball when it is snapped on a field-goal try.\nHad a flag been thrown, Succop would have had another chance from only 36 yards out. In his career, he's an 85-percent kicker from that range. Had the kick been made, Pittsburgh would be the No. 6 seed in the AFC, rather than San Diego.\nThe stupidest officiating moment, Gene Steratore edition\nSteratore doesn't get mentioned here very often because he's a damn good referee. But Sunday night, he overlooked something that could have cost the Cowboys their season. The play clock operator mistakenly gave Dallas only 25 seconds, rather than 40, after a 34-yard completion to Jason Witten in the fourth quarter. It was obvious the Cowboys didn't have enough time, but Steratore blew the play dead when the clock hit zeros and gave them a five-yard delay-of-game penalty anyway.\nNBC's Cris Collinsworth and Al Michaels noticed immediately that something wasn't right, but nobody on Steratore's crew did. And the Cowboys never protested. Shockingly stupid.\nThis actually happens quite frequently, but the officials almost always pick up on the miscue from the clock operator and pick up the flag. Not this time, and in a huge moment.\nNow, Dallas scored on the drive anyway and lost regardless, but this was a massive blunder that would have been criticized in a big way had it affected the outcome.\nThe stupidest lapse in coverage, Bengals edition\nSomeone tell the Ravens that A.J. Green is one of the five best receivers in football.\nThe stupidest lapse in coverage, Bears edition\nIt's 4th-and-8 with your season on the line, and you let this happen?\nThe stupidest example of a lack of awareness\nHow often do we see packs of players, or at least individuals, go ape$%#& in attempts to recovery fumbles that clearly weren't fumbles? The one damn time we get a fumble that is actually a fumble on a strange play, and nobody on either Chicago or Green Bay even makes an effort\u2026\nThat might have been the difference in what was the de facto NFC North championship game.\nThe stupidest front-office decision\nDo Jimmy Haslem, Joe Banner, Michael Lombardi and everyone else running the Cleveland Browns really believe the team they put on the field in 2013 was any better than its 4-12 record? Did they expect more from a team that traded its 2012 No. 3 overall pick midseason, lacked a half-decent starting quarterback and was still rebuilding on both sides of the ball?\nI don't understand how an organization gives up on a head coach 352 days into his tenure, but the Browns did exactly that on Sunday night, firing Rob Chudzinski after a 4-12 season. That makes little sense to me, or anyone in the football world not named Haslem, Banner or Lombardi.\nIn Lombardi's defense, he was named general manager after Chudzinski was hired last January. But really, that ass-backwards approach probably helped lead to this and only helps establish how stupid this entire organization is.", "id": "<urn:uuid:418883f8-f469-42d2-913b-05d782c2c2d8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2016-30", "url": "http://thecomeback.com/thisgivensunday/2013-articles/this-weekend-in-nfl-stupid-17.html", "date": "2016-07-23T21:24:15Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-30/segments/1469257823670.44/warc/CC-MAIN-20160723071023-00038-ip-10-185-27-174.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9802137017250061, "token_count": 1067}, "content": [{"line": "The final stupid weekend of what was an extremely stupid NFL regular season.

OneAmerica sold the ground to Flaherty & Collins. To make up for the hundreds of parking spots OneAmerica will lose to the project, the city will build the insurer a 930-space parking garage paid with $11 million in property tax money from Downtown's tax increment financing district.

Amenities will include a heated saltwater pool, fitness center and three courtyards.\nThe perforated panels on the parking garage were curved on site. The alternating pattern of four shades of blue were chosen to create a wave appearance. Supporting the panels is a subframing assembly unit.

OneAmerica sold the ground to Flaherty & Collins. To make up for the hundreds of parking spots OneAmerica will lose to the project, the city will build the insurer a 930-space parking garage paid with $11 million in property tax money from Downtown's tax increment financing district.

{"doc": {"text": "January 1 marks the beginning of one of my favorite times of year: garden planning time. I tend to make plans rather than resolutions, and planning my garden is always so exciting. I imagine the beautiful flowers and delicious foods I\u2019ll grow, ignoring the possibilities of weeds, droughts, and pests. Flipping through those glossy, colorful seed catalogues is enough to make my mouth water. 2012 will mark our fourth gardening year here at our home, and before that I lived on a farm surrounded by orchards and fields of a variety of different crops. Even with those experiences, I\u2019m far from a gardening expert.\nThis year, I\u2019ve made a list of ten foods that I\u2019ve never grown before. I want to learn about them and learn to grow, cook, and preserve them. They\u2019re not \u201cnew\u201d foods, but they\u2019re new to my garden.\n1. Peach Trees\nPeaches are my husband\u2019s favorite fruit, and his favorite dessert is peach pie. I was spoiled enough to have a peach orchard on the farm, and so I know that a supermarket peach just cannot compare to one that you pluck off the tree yourself. When you bite into that peach, still warm from the hot summer sun, and the juices run down your arm, that\u2019s a pure delight that everyone should get to experience.\nI plan to plant three trees to add to our tiny little orchard of six apple trees that we planted a few years ago. Growing fruit trees at home is different from those grown in a bigger orchard, and I like to select trees grown on dwarf roots, which will keep them smaller and enable us to pick them without climbing a ladder. I haven\u2019t chosen the varieties yet, but I want them to all be freestone, which means the flesh will separate easily from the pit when sliced open, and I plan to eat them fresh, bake with them, and preserve them by canning and freezing.\n2. A Cherry Tree\nTo continue adding to our little home orchard, I\u2019m going to plant a cherry tree. I am a huge fan of sweet cherries and love to eat them until my fingernails are stained purple. The problem is that my wallet can\u2019t support my cherry habit, with the price sometimes topping $5 per pound.\nI would like to plant a multi-variety tree, which consists of three to four different varieties grafted onto one dwarf root. There are a few benefits to this, including saving space in our yard, elongating the season because different varieties will ripen at different times, and giving us the flavor excitement of white cherries growing alongside dark ruby cherries. Again, it\u2019ll be a few years before any cherries are harvested.\n3. Golden Raspberries\nContinuing with our discussion of ridiculously expensive fruit, the golden (or white) raspberry is another favorite. I\u2019ve seen these golden beauties priced as high as $6 per half-pint. A half-pint is about how much I can shove into my mouth at one time! We have a little berry patch in our yard, and I\u2019m going to add six golden raspberry canes to it this spring.\nMy son Joshua (who is currently 21 months old) loves to pick berries and pop them into his mouth, so our berry patch is one of his favorite summer hangouts. It\u2019s fantastic that he will be able to enjoy a small crop of golden raspberries in their first season at our house.\nI have seen the health benefits of blueberries plastered all over the place. It seems that they are a superfood chock full of antioxidants and phytonutrients. I don\u2019t really care about the health food buzz word du jour \u2014 all I know is that they\u2019re a favorite around here.\nWe\u2019re going to add two blueberry bushes to our berry patch this summer, and hope for a good harvest in the following year. I\u2019m also going to have to invest in some bird netting, since blueberries are a favorite snack for local birds. Nets are a great, safe alternative to pesticides, and I have vivid memories of playing dress up in blueberry nets as a kid. They make beautiful bridal veils, in case you were wondering.\nWho doesn\u2019t love watermelon in summer? It\u2019s a staple at summer picnics, but I have shied away from growing it in the past because of the space it takes up in the garden. Those vines needs space to spread out, and this year I\u2019m going to look for a variety that is good for home gardening and I might even try to have it climb a trellis. We\u2019ll see.\nI\u2019m a big fan of the \u201cSugar Baby\u201d watermelons, which produce small, dark green fruits with bright pink flesh and black seeds. I don\u2019t know why, but something just feels wrong to me about seedless watermelon. Plus it is fun to spit out those seeds. I have heard fabulous things about dehydrated watermelon and how sweet it is, and I would love to try dehydrating any that we don\u2019t gobble up fresh.\nNeed I say more? We all love garlic, don\u2019t we? Garlic makes everything better. I use garlic in my cooking almost every night, so it\u2019s about time for me to learn how to grow it. Garlic is planted in the fall, so I\u2019ll have a long time before I have to pick out what variety I want to grow.\nAfter garlic is harvested, it can be dried and the stems can be braided together and hung up to continue drying. This will have the benefit of decorating my kitchen pantry while at the same time warding off vampires.\nI\u2019ve grown cabbage in the past without much success. It has a long growing season, with planting it early in the spring and not harvesting it until late summer or into the fall. I\u2019m usually too impatient for it to be taking up space in my small garden. But this year, I\u2019m going to grow some green and red cabbage.\nWe love to eat cabbage raw in coleslaw, sauteed in butter or chicken broth, or fermented in sauerkraut. There are a variety of health benefits of eating fermented foods, but I\u2019m pretty sure those are negated if you put it on a hot dog. Either way, I would like to learn to make sauerkraut and a friend has promised to teach me her crock pot method, while my uncle is going to teach me his pressure canner method. Now I just need to grow some!\nIt seems to me that no veggie better represents the \u201cback-to-the-land\u201d or \u201curban homesteading\u201d movement than kale. Its dark, frillly leaves are beacons of health, but I have a confession: I don\u2019t like kale all that much. I know I should, but I just don\u2019t. I think it is really pretty and have always liked the ornamental purple and green kale that\u2019s sold in the fall, but this year I want to learn to cook it so that I will enjoy eating it.\nKale is rich in folate, an important nutrient for all women, especially moms-to-be. Since we are thinking about adding to our family in 2012, kale is a good food for me to learn to love. These kale chips look like a good place to start!\n9. Baking Potatoes\nI have found that both red potatoes and Yukon golds are relatively easy to grow in my home garden. I basically plant them and ignore them until they look like they\u2019re dead, then dig up a bounty of potatoes. I\u2019m hoping that baking potatoes will be just as simple. I know that Joshua will love digging in the dirt this coming season!\nIn the past, I\u2019ve timed my plantings poorly and had all of my potatoes ready at the same time. This year, I\u2019d like to do a better job with succession plantings so that I can scatter the harvest and have them fresh for a longer period of time. I would also like to learn more about cold storage and keeping them throughout the winter months.\nYes, I am aware that eggs do not grow on trees. I\u2019m planning to get chickens this spring! Now, anybody who knows me knows that I have been pining for chickens and planning to get them each spring. Well, this year I mean it! Eggs are so good for us in so many ways, and it won\u2019t take many chickens to keep up with our family\u2019s needs. I\u2019m thinking a small flock of four hens will be sufficient.\nI\u2019ve already checked on zoning regulations, and our town allows for a flock of up to 20 hens in a yard our size. My husband, who is a builder by trade, will build a small, safe coop with an attached yard for them. We will be able to feed them kitchen scraps and compost their waste for use in our gardens. I have my heart set on chickens that will lay colored eggs, and I think that chicks will be the perfect Easter present for Joshua.\nNow that I\u2019ve got my top ten list, I can go back to daydreaming and thumbing through catalogues. I will post updates throughout the year, so you can see how my garden is growing, try out some recipes, and learn about preserving this food, too. Not only will we benefit from nutritious food, we\u2019ll also be reducing our environmental impact and learning while growing together as a family.\nAre you making any healthy food resolutions for the new year? Do you have any garden plans yet? Can you give me any tips?", "id": "<urn:uuid:8a11e78a-5c0f-4c71-a675-f6180fdfd4ca>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2022-21", "url": "http://naturalparentsnetwork.com/new-year-new-food/", "date": "2022-05-28T03:28:52Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2022-21/segments/1652663012542.85/warc/CC-MAIN-20220528031224-20220528061224-00000.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9602825045585632, "token_count": 2115}, "content": [{"line": "January 1 marks the beginning of one of my favorite times of year: garden planning time.

{"doc": {"text": "A good video is just part of an overall marketing strategy. It needs to be part of a plan to engage, convert and retain an audience.\nVideo has become an incredibly popular way to engage an audience.\nThere are good reasons for this.\n96% of consumers say videos help them with their buying decisions.\n77% of consumers believe that companies that create videos are more engaged with them and 73% are more likely to purchase a product or service after watching a video that explains it.\nHere are 10 ways to ensure your video strategy works for you.\n1. Know your purpose\nToo often I see organisations talking about making a video without clearly understanding why they are doing that. Being clear on what you are trying to achieve drives the entire production process.\n2. Don\u2019t sell, be helpful\nPeople will watch and share your videos when you help them. Share you knowledge and experience and it will be passed around. You will position your expertise and be seen as a helpful contributor. This will build trust and community. Think \u201chow can I provide valuable content?\u201d\n3. One message per video\nThe days of 10 minute or even 5 minute videos are gone. If you find yourself trying to fit too much information into a video, you will lose your audience. Focus on one message per video. The way in which we communicate has changed. People want easy to consume bite size pieces of information. Keep your videos simple and short.\n4. Let go of the idea of making just one video.\nConsider how to create more engagement by creating more videos.\nDevelop a storyline of content that can be rolled out over time in a series of videos. This will help build your audience and reinforce the value you bring to the marketplace.\n5. Know your audience\nToo often I see clients go off on tangents with their videos and forget about the audience. Be clear right from the outset who should be watching this and what do I need to share with them. The more focused you are on your audience the more cut through your video will have.\n6. It\u2019s not about you\nToo often I see my clients wanting to showcase what they do and how they do it. It\u2019s very common and it\u2019s often where I help my clients refocus on the real issues the viewer is interested in. We are all too close to our businesses and it helps to have an outsider show us the big picture issues that the viewers are more interested in. Talking about yourself is not going to build engagement. Showing how your services or products help the viewer will.\n7. Have a call to action\nJust like every video should have a purpose, there should be a call to action at the end of the video. The video should direct people to the next step. It may not be to make a purchase but it might to be try a sample, make a phone call, visit a website, watch another video. Be clear before you start, what is the next step I want the viewer to take. If they\u2019ve watched to the end of the video the chances are you have them on side and they will be responsive to your request.\n8. How will it be seen?\nHaving a video that no one sees is unfortunately a waste of time and money. Before making your video have a think about how you can get it seen. It\u2019s important to have a plan that extends beyond having the video on your website. Videos are a powerful way to engage an audience and can bring people to your website if distributed well. Check out this post on 30 ways to distribute your video.\n9. Repurposing opportunities\nVideo is rich media. It can be reused in many ways. Tweet key points, transcribe the content to create blogs (use blog as scripts for videos), extract the audio for those who prefer to listen than watch. Create stories around the video in articles that reference it.\n10. Measure and repeat\nWhat gets measured gets managed. There are a variety of ways to measure video engagement \u2013 number of views, number of clicks. Ultimately though your best form of measurement is based on the call to action. How much action was taken because of the video and how has that helped your organisation?\nThen when you see what is working, review and redo.\nIf you\u2019d like help to develop a video strategy that engages your audience and gets result please get in touch with me, Geoff Anderson at Sonic Sight. + 61 2 9888 1110 email@example.com\nGeoff Anderson is the owner of Sonic Sight, a video production facility in Sydney.\nHe is an author, presenter and a video producer.\nConnect with him, book him, take his course, buy his book, follow him.", "id": "<urn:uuid:44967eed-f884-4282-a980-594dec5d40c2>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2017-34", "url": "http://sonicsight.com.au/make-videos-work-for-you/", "date": "2017-08-18T04:44:52Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2017-34/segments/1502886104565.76/warc/CC-MAIN-20170818043915-20170818063915-00600.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9552654027938843, "token_count": 983}, "content": [{"line": "A good video is just part of an overall marketing strategy.

{"doc": {"text": "eyes that see not\nBy Diogenes (articles ) | Oct 10, 2006\nTo one side of the altar, a white-robed choir; on the other, a half-dozen priests of various ranks, in white robes trimmed with green vestments.\nPerhaps Rod Davis, who wrote that line, recently arrived from the planet Zork. It's in the lead paragraph of his article in D Magazine on factionalism in Episcopalian Dallas. Davis's grasp of Christian churchmanship is, to put it gently, no stronger than it needs to be. He is able to see that Anglican conservatives are upset with Bishops Robinson and Schori, and once that fact is fed into the Journalism Generator the article pretty much writes itself, and misses just about everything that's interesting and important.\nAt most recent count, at least seven of the country's 111 Episcopal dioceses and about 150 of the 7,000 congregations want \"disassociation\" or \"alternative primatial oversight\" -- the debate is replete with esoteric canon law jargon -- in one form or another. Some, like the Dallas diocese, are exploring alignment directly with Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury. Others, perhaps not convinced that Canterbury is conservative enough, may seek out Peter Akinola, archbishop of Nigeria, where there are definitely no gay bishops, but there are perhaps 20 million Anglicans. Even the irony of mostly white, conservative American suburban congregations looking to pastoral supervision from African bishops doesn't stand in the way.\nFor Davis, the last sentence is just a throwaway line. A more perceptive author would have seen it as providing a key to the controversy -- and not only to the controversy in the Episcopal Church, but to the startling change in self-understanding that the orthodox in all denominations have undergone in the past thirty years.\nA disaffected congregation splitting off from the main body is nothing new. What is new, and striking, is that these Anglicans are not huddling together for warmth with social and cultural counterparts who share their education, tastes, family connections and politics, but are aligning themselves with -- and even subordinating themselves to -- people of radically different background who believe the same essential truths to be paramount. Moreover, this remarkable venture into \"trans-cultural\" brotherhood is taking place not where we've been taught to expect it, viz., among polyglot, left-liberal cosmopolitans, but among those our betters assured us would be among the last to countenance it. Davis himself can see the sociology in broad outline, but entirely misses its ecclesial significance, as witness his account of the Christ Church parish in Plano:\nGiven its size, conservative demographics and evangelical bent, it's perhaps no surprise that this church should find itself at odds with its increasingly progressive -- or \"liberal,\" to use the pejorative term -- parent. Clearly, the people who worship here have mistaken their denominations. If not Southern Baptists by another name, surely they belong more to Joel Osteen or T.D. Jakes. This is a social church, where people come not only to worship, but also to find friends, to join groups, and to align with \"values.\"\nGot it exactly backwards. If you worship with people because they believe what you believe, strong friendships spontaneously emerge as a secondary side-effect. If you go to a church with the primary purpose of making friends, however, you have to compromise or downplay your beliefs in order to succeed. The fact that the hard core, broken-glass conservatives are connecting with Nigeria to find fellow Anglicans shows they belong overwhemingly to the former group, and cannot be linked to a \"social church\" without violence to the language.\nThe stock progressivist explanation of orthodox Christian teaching on sexuality and the sexes involves some variant of Adorno's vacuous \"fear of the other\" critique (the Anglican Communion Network crew, and Cardinal Medina-Estevez, can't accept Gene Robinson or Terese Kane because they've never been in a restaurant or on an airplane). When suburbanite Texans are willing to go to Africa to find kinship in doctrine, however, it shows that -- for some at least, faith is more important than familiarity. So who, in this reckoning, is genuinely \"conservative\"? Clearly the doctrinally orthodox are, by temperament, far more adventurous than their liberal co-religionists, who live and move and have their being in a world of seamless cultural comfort.

{"doc": {"text": "Key Facts on how charitable donations to your faith centre can go further\nIn 2016 the Charity Commission reported a peak in charitable giving during the month of Ramadan, with \u00a338 being donated by Muslims per second. In 2017 over \u00a3100 million was raised during this holy month. With Ramadan fast approaching it is a perfect time to make sure that your charitable organisation is maximising the value of donations.\nGift Aid is a scheme that enables registered charities to increase the donations they receive. Gift Aid reclaims the tax already paid on the money being donated, from HM Revenue and Custom (HMRC), for charitable causes. By claiming Gift Aid for you charitable organisation you can increase the value of the donations you receive by 25p to every \u00a31, on donations up to \u00a38000 per tax year.\nThere are several considerations to be mindful of when applying for Gift Aid. First, and foremost, gift aid can only be claimed on money that is being collected for a registered charity. Following from this, it is very important that religious institutions, and other organisations, collecting donations are well informed on the charity they are fundraising for. Finally, there are two ways that gift aid can be collected and understanding both of these options will ensure that you are not missing out on maximising all donations that are eligible for this scheme.\nDefining what a charity \u2018is\u2019 is a complex, and sometimes controversial, topic. Officially, a charity is understood as an organisation that is set up for charitable purposes and provides public benefits. Acts of giving, which may be perceived as acts of charity, may not be legally regarded as such. Many of us are familiar with the sight of collection bowls being passed around at our local places of worship, or local community centres, to raise money for issues close to the hearts our communities.\nThe causes being collected for may go towards supporting a member of the community who is sick, or too fund projects that will benefit the immediate, wider, or global community. If this money is not being collected on behalf of a registered charity, however, than they will not be liable for gift aid.\nAlthough those raising money often have the best intentions at heart, it is best to personally make sure the cause you plan to give money too is registered. The easiest way to do this is by checking for the charity registration number on The Charity Commission website.\nRegistered charities are eligible for two Gift Aid schemes:\nScheme 1: The main Gift Aid scheme allows eligible charities to claim 25p per \u00a31 donated, on up \u00a38000 per tax year, depending on eligibility. Click here for the application.\nHow to Apply:\nStep 1: Apply to HMRC for recognition as a charity or a CASC for tax purposes.\nIf your Charity has income above \u00a35000 you will have to register with the Charity Commission before applying to the HMRC.\nStep 2: Nominate an authorised official and/or nominee.\nStep 3: Fill in the R68(i) \u2018Gift Aid and tax repayment claims\u2019 form.\nAfter you have completed these steps HMRC will confirm your status as a charity and issue a reference number that you will be required to state on all correspondence with them.\nWhen collecting Gift Aid donations you will have to get a declaration from your donors, including their full name, address (including postcode), details of the donations covered by the declaration and confirmation that they are a UK taxpayer. One declaration can apply to all future donations from the donor.\nDonations can be collected in face-to-face, over the internet, and by telephone, in any circumstance you should issue all donors with a declaration and make sure that this is signed.\nYou must keep either an electronic or paper record of the declarations, showing that your donors have agreed that you can reclaim the tax on their donation.\nScheme 2: The Gift Aid small Donations scheme (GASDS) allows eligible charities to claim \u2018top-up\u2019 payments on the small cash donations they receive. This means that charities don\u2019t need the donor to complete an individual Gift Aid declaration to make a claim. In order to claim these donations, follow the steps below:\nThese small claims apply to amounts of \u00a320 per individual donation or less. Most Faith Institution Charities may claim a top-up of \u00a38000 per tax year, through this scheme, on cash that was collected after the 6th April 2017. Cash collected prior to this date are subject to different rules, which can be found on the HMRC website.\nYou are required to keep records of small donations as evidence of your claim. You should record: how much money was collected, including each denomination of coins and notes;\nthe date the money was collected;\nthat no individual donation was greater than \u00a320;\nif you\u2019ve collected contactless donations you\u2019ll need to keep the records produced by the contactless terminal.\nYou must claim on small cash donations within 2 years from the end of the tax year that you collected them, and give the total amount of the small donations when making your claim.\nHave claimed main Gift Aid (see scheme 1) in the same tax year as you want to claim a top-up payment (scheme 2)\nHow to apply:\nStep 2: activate your account using the activation code sent to you by Government Gateway, this usually take around a week to arrive and must be used within 28 days.\nStep 3: Sign into your Charities Online account, and proceed to fill out the claims form:\nSelect \u2018access service,\u2019 then \u2018make a charity repayment claim\u2019 where you will specify that you are making a Gift Aid claim.\nWhen you\u2019ve filled in details of your claim, you\u2019ll be asked for more information about your charity on a page titled \u2018About the organisation\u2019.\n- You will then be asked to fill in the \u2018repayment claim details\u2019 page, where you can tell HMRC about the donations to your charity that you can reclaim tax on. You can send these details on a document called a schedule spreadsheet.\n- You will need to save this spreadsheet to your computer and attach it to the claims form.\n- You will be taken to the declaration page to finalise your form.\n- When you have submitted a claim, you will get an on-screen confirmation with the date and time it was sent. You will also see a reference number which you must make a note of and quote in any correspondence with HMRC regarding your claim.\nFor more information, click here for a guide to applying for the small donations scheme.", "id": "<urn:uuid:87c2eca6-3dae-4418-ad02-9c8c2a5e4378>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2020-45", "url": "https://www.sfitogether.org/2018/05/04/just-in-time-for-ramadan-a-quick-guide-to-gift-aid-donations/", "date": "2020-10-25T05:17:02Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2020-45/segments/1603107887810.47/warc/CC-MAIN-20201025041701-20201025071701-00040.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.944612979888916, "token_count": 1360}, "content": [{"line": "Key Facts on how charitable donations to your faith centre can go further", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "In 2016 the Charity Commission reported a peak in charitable giving during the month of Ramadan, with \u00a338 being donated by Muslims per second.

{"doc": {"text": "I interviewed Stephanie Wells, the designer of Double Happiness whose pieces have been frequently featured on Gossip Girl, in magazines such as Seventeen and Nylon, and seen on celebrities including Nina Dobrev and Emma Roberts.\nKB: How long have you been designing jewelry for and what's the background of your line Double Happiness?\nSW: I have been designing jewelry for 11 years. I began making jewelry for myself, but quickly found others wanting to buy the pieces from me. I am 90% self taught \u2013 that is, I did not study jewelry, wire wrapping or lost wax casting. It is through many hours of trying to figure out how to manifest what is in my head and make it into reality that my techniques were born.\nKB: What are your inspirations when designing? Do you have different visions for each collection?\nSW: My raw materials are what inspire me and they change each season. Having worked with editors and stylists for years, I understand the seasonal cycles and work with colors specific to that season. BUT, I have a hard time re-working materials, that is once I work with a color and cut, I find it hard to go back and be re-inspired. Thus, I am constantly searching for new, unique materials each season. I also like to collaborate with in-need womens organizations both in the US and overseas and have been fortunate to create collections with gorgeous hand made paper beads from Uganda, amazing seed bead flowers from Afghanistan, and gorgeous African wax cloth from Rwanda.\nKB: What are your thoughts on Gossip Girl? Did you have a vision of seeing your jewelry on any particular characters?\nSW: Gossip Girl is the fashion trend leader on TV and it is an honor to be included in their fashion. I love the fact they have a variety of looks, as I like to create a variety of looks/energies when I design. I think all women have a variety of energies they like to channel \u2013 boho, chic, rocker \u2013 and I try to design to fit all our needs.\nKB: What is it like seeing your pieces on one of television's most fashion forward shows? Has being featured on Gossip Girl had a large impact on your designs?\nSW: It\u2019s extremely flattering. Gossip Girl is distributed all over the world, and it is interesting to see the response we get from people overseas. I have had sales from Jordan, England, Spain all because characters on Gossip Girl have worn my jewelry.\nKB: Can we expect to see Double Happiness on any other shows or movies?\nSW: Double Happiness Jewelry is often used in movies, TV shows and magazine editorials. I cannot usually publicize press in a TV show or magazine until the press actually hits the streets. But, I can say that the stylist for Harry's Law just picked up pieces from the line. We are also often on the Wendy Williams Show, Rachel Ray show to name a few.\nTo purchase Double Happiness Jewelry visit their website.

{"doc": {"text": "Choosing the perfect colour palette for your brand can seem like a daunting task when you don\u2019t know where to start \u2013 in this post Brand Stylist Meg Harrop shares her advice on choosing a palette based on your brand personality and values.\nColour plays a major role in making your brand recognisable and holds immense power when it comes to evoking emotions. By choosing certain colour combinations for your palette you can convey the correct values and somewhat control how your brand is perceived.\nThere are a few ways to choose colours for your brand, some designers will be able to pull colours together quite instinctively, but it helps to have a few pointers to follow if you\u2019re new to the world of branding.\nIn order to pick colours that really evoke the correct feel from your customers you\u2019ll first need to define your intentions about what that feel should be.\nHow should your brand feel to your customers? If your brand were a person what would it\u2019s personality traits or defining attributes be?\nYour brand values are also important to note down here to guide you on choosing colours. Your brand values are what you and your business stands for, and the things you\u2019re passionate about. They\u2019re also the things that your customers care about and are part of the reason they buy from you rather than another business.\nTake some time to think about these if you don\u2019t have them nailed down already, they truly are the guiding principles for everything you do within your business.\nTo make it a little easier to choose a unified colour palette you can use the framework of colour psychology which I first learnt about from Fiona Humberstone.\nWithin the colour psychology framework there are 4 colour personalities. Choosing a colour personality for your brand can really help you to pull together a beautiful palette using your brand values and your thoughts about how you want your brand to feel. It gives you a bit of a structure to follow if you don\u2019t feel confident in knowing which colour tones convey which emotions.\nThe colour personalities are seasonal and their key attributes are:\nPlayful, bright, energetic, optimistic, joyful, optimistic, creative, open, quick thinking. Spring personalities value openness, communication, imagination, and creativity.\nColours will need to be light, bright, warm, and clear to match the bountiful energy that Spring brings. Pastels fit in well here but colours can also be brighter. Yellows, pinks, turquoises, greens and even oranges and reds can fit here.\nA perfect Spring personality business is Susana Torralbo \u2013 Just look at that joyful and energetic mix of yellows, pinks, and greens. The colours feel warm but there is a light, bright background of white in many of the photos.\nTypes of businesses that fit well here are creative agencies, youthful businesses, shops selling children clothes or nursery decor, but don\u2019t be put off if your business is none of these things. It\u2019s all about the feel you want to portray.\nGraceful, romantic, serene, sensual, organised, aspirational, understated. Spring personalities value logical thinking, quality, balance, supportiveness, and tradition.\nWhere spring brings bold energy, summer slows it down and the pace becomes a little slower, colours are a little more muted to suit the longer, warm hazy days. Colours are delicate, and often slightly cooler.\nA perfect Summer personality business is The Home of Eve with their classic deep green mixed with soft pinks \u2013 understated, elegant and luxurious.\nTypes of businesses that fit well here are jewellery designers, floral businesses, gift shops, wedding planners, luxurious and high quality businesses.\nPassionate, rustic, warm, earthy, organic, artisan, authentic. Autumn personalities value enthusiasm, community, heritage, history, and justice.\nAutumn picks up the pace and the energy a little again with the prolific fruit that\u2019s ready to harvest at this time of year. Colours will need to be warm, intense, deep, and energetic.\nA perfect Autumn business is Magic Organic Apothecary with their completely natural beauty products. Deep browns and greens feature here with lots of natural textures and colours. There is a wide range of colours available for Autumn, make sure they feel warm and full of life.\nTypes of businesses that fit well here are handmade and artisan products, natural and organic businesses, outdoor businesses, and charities.\nStrong, minimal, dramatic, bold, opulent, expert, practical, focused. Winter personalities value experience, discipline, vision, and strength.\nColours will need to be bold, minimal, and cool. Think black and white, with perhaps some pops of bold, intense colour and maybe a metallic.\nA perfect Winter personality is Vogue! High end jewellery and fashion fits well here along with super professional businesses.\nTip: Note that each season can include many colours, it is more about how warm or cool the colour is, or how bright or muted, and how it feels next to the personality traits. Your business may have a little of more than one season and that\u2019s ok, just make sure you\u2019re not pulling colour from all the seasons! There is really no right or wrong to this, keep referring back to your intention for how you want to portray your brand.\nYou can also use these seasonal personalities to help you choose other elements for your branding (typography, photography styles, illustration styles) but to keep things simple we\u2019ll stick to talking about colour here.\nPull colours together (in design software or online software like Canva) based on your season. You\u2019ll eventually want to narrow it down to around 6-8 colours (You may want less depending on how minimal your palette needs to be!).\nSearch for the meaning of colours on Google to help you narrow down your colours more. There is an abundance of information already on the internet to tell you what blue means and what green means and so on.\nYour seasonal personality should work to qualify each colour and determine how bright or muted, or how warm or cool it is. So for example if you know you need a green and your personality is summer, you might use a classic, deep, slightly cool green.\nOnce you have one main colour you can move onto what works with that first colour. One other contrasting main colour works well, and then 3-4 complimentary colours that blend in well.\nThis last stage may take you a little while to complete, get to a point and then walk away. Come back to it the next day to see if anything has shifted, does everything feel harmonious?

Check out these tips on How to Skip Long Lines at Disney\u2019s Pandora, no frantic Fastpass checking required!\nI know that lines aren\u2019t the end of the world. And most of the time I embrace them and try to make the most out of them with fun games and getting to know the people around me.\nBut that 200 minute wait is just not something I can get behind.\nAnd if you\u2019re out of luck with the Fastpasses and waiting is your only option, spending half of your day in line for a popular attraction is bound to make anyone cranky. So what\u2019s a girl (or guy) to do when your must-do line is hours long? The answer is simple, and it\u2019s super easy too!\nChris and I visited Pandora way back when it first opened last year. I was never a huge fan of Avatar so I was a bit skeptical about the new land but I ended up loving it. There\u2019s so much to photograph and Flight of Passage is easily the best ride at Disney.\nI\u2019m not kidding, the ride is ah-mazing.\nI know a lot of people check the Fastpass+ page a lot to see if they can grab one of those coveted Fastpasses for the ride. They\u2019re hard to come by and if you don\u2019t grab them when your window opens to book them then the chances are slim that you\u2019ll be able to grab one at all. Slim, but not impossible.\nBut what if you can\u2019t get a Fastpass? Are you just out of luck?\nThere are a few other ways to skip long lines at Disney\u2019s Pandora.\n+ Get to DAK before the park opens\nI\u2019m not a morning person at all so this isn\u2019t my style but you can get to Animal Kingdom and line up for Pandora before the park opens. Once they start letting people in you can do your fast walk (don\u2019t run!) to the ride and get in line early. My only suggestion is to PLEASE keep your party together because it\u2019s so annoying to have one person run up to get a primo spot and have the other 5 people in their party have to push their way in front to join them.\nDon\u2019t be that person y\u2019all. Please don\u2019t.\n+ Jump in line right before the park closes\nThis is more my speed and Chris and I do it with popular rides all the time. All the Fastpass people have gotten in line by then which means the line will start moving faster for non-Fastpassers. That two hour wait can easily drop down to 60-90 minutes (depending) and you\u2019ll spend way less time in line. Plus, the people waiting at the end of the night are much nicer than those who who are waiting in the hot sun all day. We\u2019ve made quite a few line buddies at the end of the night and it\u2019s always fun!\n+ Check for Fastpasses the morning you\u2019re heading to the parks\nWhile this isn\u2019t always guaranteed I\u2019ve found that Disney sometimes releases more Fastpasses for the popular rides the morning of. So if you\u2019ve been checking Disney\u2019s My Experience App every day up until your trip with no luck, you may want to try again the morning of. You may get lucky!\nAnd on that note, keep trying every day up until your park day. People release Fastpasses all the time and you may get lucky and snatch one up!\nThese methods aren\u2019t always fool-proof and you may not always get lucky with a short wait. If that happens, come armed with a few games to play on your phone or get chummy with the people around you. I swear that line waiting is more fun when you make friends!\nYou can apply these rules to any of the popular rides at Disney (we\u2019ve jumped in line many times for Frozen at Epcot right before the park closed!) so that you have more time during the day for other attractions.

{"doc": {"text": "by Luminita Molico\nAssuming the period starting after the end of the Cold War as postmodern, Lupton (1999 pp.11-2) states that the status quo is dominated by a constant reevaluation of established thought and deconstruction of tradition. Further citing Giddens 1990; Massumi 1993; Lash and Urry 1994; Featherstoe 1995; Lupton (1999 pp.11-2) identifies postmodernity as an era dominated by uncertainty and ambivalence towards \u2018change and flux, cultural fragmentation and the breakdown of norms and traditions\u2019.

{"doc": {"text": "Stocks Hit Highs While Uncertain Credit Union Members Continue to Save\nThe Dow Jones industrial average in recent days has ended a surge that the markets hadn\u2019t seen in 17 years.\nFor some, it was one more sign that the nation\u2019s economy may be continuing to move along the road to recovery. Industry watchers said the Dow\u2019s ascension, which started at close to 14,254 on March 5 and peaked at 14,514 on March 15, was fueled by several factors, including a spike in gas prices.\nInvestors may have either been spooked by the record rise or made some adjustments to their portfolio mix.\nFor credit union members, who tend to err on the side of conservative, the Dow\u2019s increase might have aligned with their savings, which were up in January, according to CUNA Mutual Group\u2019s March Credit Union Trends Report.\nThe timing of the Dow\u2019s record movement coincides with the latest update from an initiative between CU Solutions Group and SaveUp. According to the Michigan Credit Union League & Affiliates, which owns CU Solutions Group, SaveUp is a free rewards program that encourages consumers to make positive changes to their financial behaviors.\nMore than 40 credit unions have signed on with SaveUp since the alliance launched six months ago.\nEvery time members contribute to their savings or retirement accounts, pay down their credit cards, mortgages or other loans or engage with SaveUp\u2019s financial education content, they earn credits they can use to win prizes from sponsors such as Virgin America, Banana Republic and GameStop, as well as a $2 million jackpot, CUSG said.\nFor the $737 million Northeast Credit Union in Portsmouth, N.H., SaveUp has served several roles particularly with certain member niches and their spending and long-term planning goals, said Andrea Pruna, vice president of marketing at Northeast.\n\u201cSaveUp is a great innovative tool to engage with the Gen Y market, reward positive member behavior and help plan our marketing tactics using its incredibly useful data reports,\u201d Pruna said.\nUnlike their baby boomer counterparts, Gen X and Gen Y have a bit more time to plan for retirement. To target these younger members, SaveUp recently released its first U.S. Consumer Savings and Debt Report with its major findings focused on the financial habits of Gen X and Gen Y.\nWith Gen X, average mortgage debt was $181,706, which was 21% above the U.S. average.

{"doc": {"text": "Cyclop\u00e6dia of Political Science, Political Economy, and the Political History of the United States\nINTEREST is the product, the increase (incrementum), the return (reditus) from capital. When interest represents the sum paid at fixed periods by the borrower to the loaner of capital, it retains its generic name, or takes the more special designation of rent or income. The price charged by the proprietor for the use of land leased by him, is rent. The term income is more particularly applied to the product of capital employed in commerce, agriculture or manufactures. In brief, interest signifies equally the profit the capitalist derives from the direct employment of his capital, and the return he receives for granting its use to others for a certain length of time.\n\u2014No difficulty can arise with respect to the profits of a capitalist who employs his own capital: the interest on capital is in this case blended with the product of his labor. If a field be cultivated, or a workshop used by its owner, he has to render no account to any one. The operation is in a certain sense a domestic one, giving rise to nothing requiring regulation. Whether the capital employed by its possessor returns 5 per cent. or 20 per cent., whether it is productive or unproductive, concerns only the producer\u2014pertains only to the proprietor. Nothing in relation to it comes within the province of legislation, which only extends to matters which affect relations among men. But the moment the owner of capital so far relinquishes its use as to lease it, if it be immovable property, or to loan it at interest, if it be movable property, a contract is formed between the one who delivers and the one who receives. From this contract arise rights and obligations for each of the contracting parties, which it is for the law to determine for the advantage of both parties; and consequences also arise from it which it is the mission of political economy to observe, in order to deduce from them, as much for the benefit of individuals as of society, the lessons of experience.\n\u2014I. LOANS AT INTEREST. Is it permissible to loan at interest? Can one legitimately derive a product from his capital, a revenue from his money? On this question, which no longer seems to be one, the world, until toward the latter part of the last century, was divided. Loans at interest had in their favor the constant practice of peoples, especially of those noted for their progress in wealth, commerce and industry; on the other side were the oracles of religion and the doctors of the law. Now that theology has become more humane on this point, and jurisprudence has relaxed its rigor, socialism has taken up the thesis of the abolition of interest. The sophism has only changed defenders. Instead of justifying this interference with capital on the ground of charity or in consequence of unenlightened views in regard to morality, appeal is now made to envy and the anarchical passions.\n\u2014The (so-called) laws of Moses recognized the legitimacy of loaning at interest, for it was only prohibited the Jews in their relations with their own countrymen, who were considered as members of the same family; and credit transactions with foreigners, as well as commercial ones, were wholly free. The laws of Solon, made for an essentially commercial people, placed no restriction or limit on the employment of money. At Rome, the severity of the legislation on this subject only provoked disobedience. Capital, which was persecuted, became exacting in proportion to the risks to which it was exposed. Nowhere was theory more strangely in contradiction with practice. Cato, who compared usury (i.e., interest) to assassination, was himself an avaricious and pitiless usurer; and the stern Brutus loaned at 48 per cent. per annum.\n\u2014In the middle ages the civil and religious authorities were in accord in prohibiting loans at interest. This interdiction, already written in the capitularies of Aix la Chapelle, in 789, was perpetuated in French law until the revolution of 1789. But, during this long millenium, the observance of the legal precept was purely nominal. To evade it, recourse was had to subtleties without number. First the bill of exchange, and afterward the establishment of annuities, furnished the most simple and usual means. Later, people came to tolerate loans by note, discount, and every species of money negotiation between tradesmen. Sovereigns themselves needed to borrow, and were obliged to submit to the conditions of money-lenders. Everywhere the force of circumstances overcame the obstacle of antiquated and anti-social legislation.\n\u2014The prejudice against loans at interest may be traced back to the time of Aristotle, and has its source in his writings. The following are the terms in which the Greek philosopher teaches the too-well-known doctrine of the sterility of money: \"The acquisition of wealth being double, that is to say, at once commercial and domestic, the latter necessary and rightfully esteemed, the former not less justly despised as not being natural and not resulting from the sale of commodities, it is quite right to execrate usury, because it is a mode of acquisition born of money itself and not giving it the destination for which it was created. Money should serve only for exchange, and the interest of it increases it, as its Greek name sufficiently indicates. Here the fathers are absolutely like the children: interest is money which is the issue of money, and of all acquisitions, it is that most contrary to nature.\" The anathema pronounced by Aristotle against trade in money, extends, as may be seen, to every kind of commercial operation. He did not comprehend, though living in the midst of people pre-eminently commercial, the utility of the r\u00f4le commerce plays in society. He did not see that to bring nations into contact with each other, to open the ways to markets, to place products within the reach of consumers, was to give them value, was, in a certain sense, to produce them.\n\u2014In a treatise aimed against loans at interest, another Greek moralist, Plutarch, exclaims: \"What! you are men, you have feet, hands, and a voice, and you say you do not know how to get a living! The ants neither borrow nor lend; yet they have not hands, or arts, or reason; but they live by their labor, because they are content with things necessary. If people were willing to be content with things necessary, there would be no more usurers than there are centaurs.\" Plutarch here alludes to the rich who expended money in excess of their income, and who ruined themselves by loans contracted to give free indulgence to passing fancies; but, even in those times, the debauchees and prodigals were not the only ones who borrowed. There were already industries which needed capital, and traders who had recourse to interest loans, or loans for a share in the profits to bring their operations to an end or to extend them. The treasures accumulated by saving acquired by commerce, or obtained by victory, were not always dissipated in luxury and in pleasures; they sometimes served to stimulate production and to develop wealth. Money was at that time an instrument of labor. The capitalists who loaned it for that use, rendered service to borrowers and to society. They had consequently a right to receive pay for this service. Plutarch, on account of his preoccupation with the abuses of loans at interest, failed to perceive their good results.\n\u2014The fathers of the church who treated this question, only copied Aristotle and Plutarch. \"The lenders,\" said St. Basil, \"enrich themselves by the poverty of others; they derive advantage from the hunger and nakedness of the poor. To take interest, is to gather where one has not sown.\" St. Chrysostom, insisting on this argument, exclaims, in a style loaded with metaphors: \"What is there more unreasonable than to sow without land, without rain, without a plowshare? All those who devote themselves to that damnable agriculture, harvest only tares. * * * Let us, then, cut off these monstrous children begotten of gold and silver, let us stifle this execrable fecundity * * *.\" St. Ambrose, St. Augustine and St. Jerome held the same language. The following is a dilemma of the latter, which, if it is inspired by charity, is hardly so by logic: \"Have you loaned to him who had, or to him who had not? If he had, why loan to him? If he had not, why do you ask of him more, as if he had?\"\n\u2014It is easy to reply that if one loans to those who have, it is because they do not always hold all their resources at their full disposal, and a timely loan of money permits them to await the receipt of their revenues. As to those who possess nothing, by loaning them capital one gives them the means of making their labor productive; one places in their hand the lever of wealth. If they had no credit, they would be still poorer; and they should at least, in consideration of the unexpected good, pay for the use of the money they have borrowed.\n\u2014Another doctor in the church, Gerson, the author of \"Imitation of Christ,\" says: \"It is better that there be some light usuries which procure help for the indigent, than to see them reduced by poverty to theft, waste of property, and selling their furniture and immovable property at a very low price.\"\n\u2014The church also condemned sales on time, as a stipulation was made in them in regard to interest on deferred payments. This was, according to the schoolmen, \"to sell time, which can not be sold, since God has made it common to all.\" Strange to say, this maxim of the canon law was first proclaimed by the council of Coventry, in England, the very country where the popular adage, \"Time is money,\" was afterward invented.\n\u2014But no one carried the prejudice against loans at interest (which, since the ninth century, had been stigmatized by the name of usury) farther than Luther, the originator of the religious reformation. His view of the subject is thus given in his \"Table Talk\": \"The civil laws themselves prohibit usury. To exchange anything with any one and gain by the exchange is not a deed of charity; it is robbery. Every usurer is a robber worthy of the gibbet. I call those usurers who loan at five or six per cent. To-day, at Leipzig, he who loans a hundred florins, asks forty for them at the end of the year as interest on his money. Do you think God will tolerate such a thing? There is nothing under the sun I hate so much as that city of Leipzig; there is so much usury, avarice, insolence, trickery and rapacity there.\"\n\u2014More passion than knowledge entered into the judgment given by Luther. The Roman church had at that time relaxed its severity in regard to loans at interest. Its allies, the Florentines, had become rich by trading in money throughout Europe. In inveighing against bankers, Luther thought he was also inveighing against popes. Calvin showed better judgment, in not allowing himself to be turned from the examination of doctrines by considerations of party or of persons. He vigorously attacked the economic theory of Aristotle on the sterility of money. \"Money, it is said, does not beget money. And does the sea produce it? Is it the fruit of a house, for the use of which, nevertheless, I receive a rent? Is money begotten, to speak properly, from the roof and walls? No, but the earth produces it; the sea bears ships which serve in a productive commerce, and with a sum of money a comfortable dwelling may be procured. If, then, more profit can be derived from money negotiations than from the cultivation of a field, why should not the possessor of a sum of money be permitted to derive from it any sum whatever, since the proprietor of a sterile field is permitted to lease it for a farm rent? And when land is acquired by the payment of money, does not this capital produce an annual revenue? What, pray, is the source of the profits of the merchant? His industry, you will say, and his diligence. Who doubts that money unemployed is useless wealth? He who demands capital, apparently wishes to use it as an instrument of production. It is not then from the money itself that the profit comes, but from the use that is made of it.\" (Calvin's letters.)\n\u2014Doctrines have as much influence as laws on the development of public prosperity. Protestant nations certainly owe to Calvin their superiority to Catholic nations, since the sixteenth century, in commerce and manufactures. Freedom to loan for interest gave rise in them to credit; and credit has doubled their power.\n\u2014Not until two centuries later did Montesquieu dare, for the first time in France, to profess the same principles. \"Money,\" says the author of the \"Spirit of Laws,\" \"is the sign of values. It is clear that he who needs this sign should hire it, as he does other things he needs. * * * It is indeed a very kind act to loan money to a person without interest; but we perceive that this can only be a religious precept and not a civil law. In order that commerce be successful, money must have a value. If money has no value, no one will loan it, and the merchant can no longer undertake anything. I err in saying that no one will loan it. The business of society must always go on: usury becomes established, but with the disadvantages always experienced from it. The law of Mohammed confounds usury with interest. Usury increases, in Mohammedan countries, in proportion to the severity of the prohibition. The lender indemnifies himself for the peril of the contravention.\"\n\u2014Montesquieu here, under cover of his criticism of the laws of Mohammed, brings a charge against Christian society. Loaning at interest was still under condemnation in France, both by the canons of the church and the laws of the state, at the time when the \"Spirit of Laws\" appeared. A magistrate could less openly brave that double authority than any other citizen. Hence the artifice of the author. He applies his criticism to the past, or transfers it to the Orient. It is for French society to recognize itself in the picture, if it desires. The following reign relieved writers from that somewhat hypocritical reserve; and political economy, in the writings of Turgot, set forth principles with entire freedom.\n\u2014The constituent assembly sanctioned these principles. The law of Oct. 12, 1789, by proclaiming the legitimacy of loans at interest, put an end to a controversy which had been prolonged for twenty centuries: \"All private citizens, bodies, communities and mortmain people\" (i.e., those holding property which they could not alienate) \"shall be able henceforth to loan for a fixed time, for interest stipulated according to the rates determined by law.\" The new law was written, in terms no less explicit, in article 1905 of the civil code, thus: \"It is permitted to stipulate interest for a simple loan, whether of money or provisions or other movable property.\"\n\u2014Since that time loans at interest have been in accordance with civil law in France. Is this likewise natural law? Can reason, based upon the principles of morality and public utility, approve what the law declares? The Catholic church itself no longer contests it. If any are still doubtful on this point, we would refer them to the fine dissertations of the Cardinal of Luzerne and Cardinal Gousset. And as to the jurists who still rely on the arguments of Pothier, they have only to read the learned and often eloquent refutation of them given by M. Troplong, in his \"Treatise on Loans.\" But the thesis which jurisprudence and theology have abandoned, has become a revolutionary commonplace. Loans at interest could find no favor with the socialistic school, which has declared war on capital, and on whose banner is inscribed: \"Property is robbery.\" The theological school, in its arguments against interest loans, showed itself inconsistent. While it forbade the capitalist to collect a monthly or an annual due for the money borrowed of him, it permitted the landowner to lease his land in consideration of a farm rent, and to grant the use of his house to a tenant for a stipulated sum. The prohibition consequently applied to the form of the investment and not to the investment itself. The capitalist was prohibited, not from investing his capital, but from investing it in a certain manner. For lack of having analyzed the nature and having followed in its course the circulation of wealth, and, in consequence, of taking the sign for the thing signified, and the precious metals for value, a sort of embargo was put on money. In virtue of a preconceived theory which represented money as a sterile metal, they really impressed it with sterility.\n\u2014It is clear, however, that if the possessor of a sum of money has not the right to make it productive and to derive a revenue from it, the possessor of land could not, with any better right, lease it to a farmer to cultivate, in consideration of an income or rent from it. The earth, in fact, does not spontaneously engender a revenue any more than does money. Under both forms, capital is only the instrument of labor. He who receives it, must pay the price to him who leases it. The borrower owes the price in both cases, or he owes it in neither. There is no way of getting out of this dilemma.\n\u2014\"Coined money,\" says M. Troplong very justly, \"the creation of man and not of nature, is in turn utilized as a commodity, or as a sign of values, without there being any reason to cry out against this two-fold employment of it. It must submit to the condition of matter, which is to be a slave of man, and must serve all the uses and necessities that it can reasonably satisfy. So far, then, from disparaging the means of acquisition invented by the genius of man, in imitation of the natural and primitive means of acquisition, we should, on the contrary, recognize that this is the masterpiece of civilization, which opens to social activity new careers, new sources of labor, new and admirable means of promoting comfort among the classes who have inherited no wealth. Plutarch thought he was overwhelming the loaners by an irresistible argument, when he told them that they made something out of nothing. But, without knowing it, he gave the finest eulogy on credit which derives wealth from sterility. Money is no more impressed with infecundity than everything around us; for there is nothing productive for man save what is fertilized by labor or utilized by necessities which pay for their satisfaction. What would the earth produce, save tares and thistles, without the plowshare? What revenue would a house give its owner, if the necessity of a dwelling did not oblige a neighbor to lease it? * * Money becomes productive by the need the borrower has of it, the same as a building becomes productive by the need the tenant experiences of occupying it. Money is sterile only when it remains unemployed. Hence we see the confusion into which the canonists fall, when, granting that money may be made productive by industry, they insist on saying that in interest loans, it is the industry of the borrower, which, keeping the money active, renders it productive, and that, since the lender has no part in that industry, he should have no part in the benefits it procures. But what matters it to the lender what use the borrower makes of the loan? * * It is about as if the lessor of property should have scruples about the legitimacy of his contract because the tenant who rented his house did not occupy it. * * The price the lender receives is not a part of the profit the borrower will make by his industry; it is the price of the transfer which the lender makes to him, for a certain time, of the ownership of a sum that he has declared will be useful to him: a price the legitimacy of which rests on the deprivation the lender imposes upon himself, and on the advantage alleged by the borrower, usura propter usum.\"\n\u2014What M. Troplong here affirms, with general assent, is exactly what socialism denies. \"He who lends,\" says Proudhon, \"in the ordinary conditions of the trade of the lender, does not deprive himself of the capital which he lends; he lends it, because he has nothing to do with it for himself, being sufficiently provided with capital; he loans it, in short, because it is neither his desire, nor within his power, to give it value himself; because in keeping it in his hands, this capital, sterile by nature, would remain sterile; while, by the loan and the interest resulting from it, he produces a profit which enables the capitalist to live without labor.\" (From third letter to M. Bastiat.)\n\u2014That eminent economist, M. Bastiat, whose early loss to economic science we deplore, has remarked that this argument attacks sales as well as loans. If it can be alleged that the possessor of a sum of money does not deprive himself of it, by loaning it, why could we not say the same of the one who sells commodities which he possesses in too great abundance? The system of Proudhon would render every commercial transaction impossible, because there is not a single one which is not based on interest on the capital invested.\n\u2014But we do not need to appeal to analogies nor to enter upon comparisons, to refute a theory based on a position outside of facts accepted by everybody, and in opposition to these facts. Let us go directly to the root of the sophism. Socialism claims that the loan should not bear interest while the one who loans does not deprive himself, and that the lender suffers no privation while the capital loaned would remain sterile in his hands. This is an absolutely gratuitous allegation. First, if the capital borrowed must not produce interest, I can not see why the capitalist should part with it in favor of the borrower. People keep money only to derive an income from it; and if money must remain unproductive, people will cease to loan it. This will be the end of credit.\n\u2014But nothing appears to have a weaker foundation than this thesis of the necessary unproductiveness of capital in the hands of the capitalist. In one form or another, a capitalist always employs his money. He loans it at interest only when other forms of investment offer either a less return or one more uncertain; but in lack of a profitable loan, what prevents him from employing his money in agriculture, manufactures or commerce? It is surely lawful for him to buy land or a manufactory; and if he does not wish to put his own hand to the work, he can always take an agriculturist or a manufacturer as a partner, invest his funds in a joint stock association, or obtain shares in some marine enterprise or in railroads. In interdicting loans at interest, the socialists have forgotten to interdict association or to close the ways to human activity.\n\u2014The socialists, however, more consistent in this than the canonists, prohibit rent of land as well as interest on money. For them, the productiveness of capital, as Proudhon does not hesitate to say, is a pure fiction. What is there, if one reasons in this way, real in the world? Will the socialists always have eyes only not to see? The earth, from one end to the other of the countries which civilization has touched with its wand, recounts the marvels of capital. Capital is everywhere present. It is the universal motor, the soul of industry; it is the trace of the sojourn or the passage of man on the earth, that which distinguishes culture from barbarism. The power of a people is measured by the extent of its accumulation of labor. A farm in Beance, in France, of the same extent of land as could be bought in Canada or New Zealand for $800, would cost $80,000; and in an uninhabited country it can be had for nothing. Whence the difference in value? From the fact that the land which the colonists buy in New Zealand, for instance, is land yet to be tilled, land without capital; while he who acquires a domain in Beauce pays for the capital incorporated in it. The productiveness of soil enriched by fertilizers, improved by cultivation, provided with cattle and instruments of tillage, furnished with farm buildings and dwellings, and near to great markets\u2014all these make the difference.\n\u2014And should the owner of this wealth, which often represents the accumulated labor of many centuries, rent it for nothing, like land covered with bushes and brambles, such as met the eyes of the first occupant? Not only would this be contrary to equity, but it would be physically impossible. A state of society in which proprietors who did not cultivate the soil with their own hands should be condemned to give it over, without compensation, to farmers who would derive the benefits of the labor previously expended on it, in addition to the profits from their own labor, would not be long in coming to an end. The abolition of rent would speedily entail the abolition of property.\n\u2014The socialistic theory of exchange belongs to a purely imaginary world. At no period of history has it even begun to be applied. Suppose men reduced to their own powers in a newly forming society. As certain individuals prove to be more richly endowed by nature or make a better use of their faculties, there will necessarily be workmen who will produce more than others, whose products will not find their equivalents in exchange, and will form an excess, a reserve, a capital; hence inequality of conditions and of fortunes. This inequality, when it exists, is transmitted or may be transmitted. Property implies inheritance. When we recognize in man the right to dispose of the results of his labor, we are inevitably led to admit that he may dispose, by the same right, of the results of labor which have been accumulated by him or his ancestors\u2014in a word, of capital. To arrest this natural direction of human activity, the Banque du Peuple is a poor invention. [An allusion to a \"People's Bank\" instituted by Proudhon for the suppression of capital. E. J. L.] It would not, in fact, be sufficient to abolish rent of money and rent of land; it would be necessary, by a more radical and more logical process, to go so far as to abolish property. Communism is the last term of that theory, in which a subtle mind has imperfectly succeeded in disguising the absurdity and violence of the ideas by the novelty and charm of the form.\n\u2014II. RATE OF INTEREST. The legitimateness of loans at interest is to-day recognized in the principal states of Europe. But while abandoning the ground of absolute prohibition, governments have not had the courage openly to avow the doctrines of liberty. Just as it is sought to protect agriculture and manufactures against foreign competition, it is claimed that the cause of the borrower may be defended against the lender, and of the poor against the rich, by fixing the rate of interest or limiting it by the establishment of a maximum. Whoever, in loaning, exceeds this legal rate, exposes himself to a penalty. Usury no longer signifies the interest on money. This word, modified from its primitive sense, takes an opprobrious meaning, and becomes a mark of infamy. To invest one's money at a rate the law discountenances, is called practicing usury, and is to commit a crime.\n\u2014The laws which interdicted loans at interest have had their day; the laws which regulate the rate of interest will pass away in like manner. By examining the effects of this legislation, it is easy to show that it defeats its purpose. What is proposed to be accomplished by excepting money from the common rule of values, the level of which is determined by competition in the market? It is desired to prevent the price of that commodity from rising beyond measure, or, in other words, to oppose a barrier to the rise in interest. Now, observation teaches us that the more restrictions the laws have placed upon trade in money, in the past, the higher has become the rent of capital. The penalties against usury give rise to it or develop it; they are an added risk to those naturally connected with investments of capital. In compensation for this additional peril, the lender can not fail to demand a premium. The laws which augment the risk also discourage competition. The number of lenders and the amount of the disposable capital then diminishes, the number and eagerness of the borrowers remaining the same; and people are then astonished at the high price of the commodity, when they have done all they could to produce this condition of the market!\n\u2014In ancient times, the peoples who allowed the greatest liberty in the investment of capital were also those who saw commerce and the industries flourish in their midst, and among whom borrowers obtained the most moderate terms from lenders. The nations, on the contrary, who gave no latitude to credit transactions, or security for credits, were obliged to submit to pay more dearly than others for money. The history of Athens and that of Rome present conspicuous and instructive types of this contrast. At Rome a debtor who did not meet his engagements when due became the slave of the creditor. At Athens the right of the creditor to the person of the debtor was abolished by the laws of Solon. Solon did not attempt to regulate the interest on money, and no trace of usury laws is found in the annals of that commercial republic. The rate of interest at Athens varied according to the circumstances and with the security offered by borrowers. The lowest rate appears to have been 10 per cent.: this was in fact a very moderate charge for movable capital, at a time when the income from land was 12 per cent. to those who did not work their lands themselves, and when maritime commerce, which attracted money as well as men, borrowed at from 20 per cent. to 36 per cent., and when the industries, employing slaves as workmen, returned fabulous profits. The interest on money was in proportion to the profits on labor; and here we see why the question of debts, that permanent cause of troubles in the Roman empire, never excited either commotions or political agitations in Greece.\n\u2014In the early days of the Roman republic the rate of interest was not regulated by law. M. Troplong considers this latitude in regard to transactions as the cause of the oppression the people suffered from the patricians. But did the law of the Twelve Tables, which fixed the interest at 10 per cent. per annum, diminish the ravages of usury at Rome, and bring about a fall in interest? M. Troplong himself cites from Titus Livy and Plutarch numerous instances which superabundantly prove the contrary. Montesquieu was not in error on this point. \"As the Roman people,\" he says, \"were daily becoming more powerful, the magistrates sought to flatter them by having such laws enacted as were most pleasing to them: capital was restricted; interest diminished and finally prohibited; bodily constraint was taken away; and at last the abolition of debts was proposed, whenever a tribune wished to render himself popular. These continual changes, either by laws or by piebiscits, naturalized usury at Rome; for the creditors, seeing the people their debtors, their legislators and their judges, had no longer any confidence in contracts. The people, like discredited debtors, could borrow only at high rates; and this was the more so, because, though the laws only occasionally interfered, the complaints of the people were continuous, and always intimidated the creditors. Thus were all honorable means of loaning and borrowing abolished at Rome, and a frightful usury became established.\"\n\u2014The results in modern times have been the same. The only nations or states in which the trade in money has been most regular and confined to reasonable limits, are the very ones where the greatest freedom in money transactions has been tolerated or authorized. It is sufficient to mention Genoa, Venice, Florence, Holland and England. Holland, in the seventeenth century, although its credit was weakened by war, borrowed at 4 per cent.; in England, the current interest was 3 per cent. toward the middle of the eighteenth century. Owing to their ability to give value to their capital, the Florentines and Milanese, in the sixteenth century, under the name of Lombards, took the place of the Jews, in a large way, and became the bankers of Europe. Freedom in the matter of interest favored the establishment of credit institutions. The foundation of the bank of England and that of Amsterdam were nearly a century earlier than that of the bank of France.\n\u2014Moreover, the fall in interest and the development of commerce, in the states where there was the greatest toleration for credit transactions, appear to have followed step by step the progress of this liberty. Thus, in England, Henry VIII. had fixed the rate of interest at 10 per cent. Edward VI. absolutely interdicted loaning at interest. Elizabeth gave an impulse to trade by abrogating the statute of Edward and re-established 10 per cent. as a maximum rate, thus indirectly giving much latitude to traffic in money.\n\u2014The statute of Queen Anne fixed the rate of interest at 5 per cent. per annum, and pronounced every contract void in which the interest should exceed this rate. In accordance with the usual practice of the English, who rarely act from general principles, this statute was long nominally in force after being allowed to become practically obsolete. Then it was abrogated by successive degrees, a part at a time. The act of the fifty-ninth year of George III. (1812) was the first attack made on the principle. It was enacted that a bill of exchange or a bill payable to order, which might be declared void because of usury, should be valid in the hands of one who had taken it in good faith. Then came the act of the fourth year of William IV. (1833), which, in renewing the privilege of the bank of England, abrogated the usury laws in the kingdom, so far as bills of exchange and notes payable to order on three months or less were concerned. The act of the first year of Victoria's reign extended the exemption to bills of exchange and notes payable to order, the term of which did not extend beyond a year; and the act of the third year of the same reign comprehended also all loan contracts made for sums which exceeded \u00a310, provided the loan was not secured by a mortgage on real estate.\n\u2014In consequence of the latter provision, landed property had now to pay higher than the current market rates for money, and was, therefore, at a disadvantage in comparison with manufactures and commerce. Such an inequality before the law could not permanently continue. In 1854 a law was enacted (17 and 18 Vict., ch. 90) repealing all existing statutes against usury, though not touching the statutes in reference to pawnbrokers. These were modified later (35 and 36 Vict., ch. 93).\n\u2014The above-mentioned changes in the laws made to regulate the rate of interest appear to have been a result of the celebrated resolutions which were reported to the house of commons in 1818, in the following language. \"1st, Resolved, that it is the opinion of this committee that the laws regulating or restraining the rate of interest have been extensively evaded, and have failed of the effect of imposing a maximum on such rate; and of late years, from the constant excess of the market rate of interest above the rate limited by law, they have added to the expense incurred by borrowers on real security, and that such borrowers have been compelled to resort to the mode of granting annuities on lives, a mode which has been made a cover for obtaining higher interest than the rate limited by law, and has further subjected the borrowers to enormous charges or forced them to make very disadvantageous sales of their estates. 2d, Resolved, that it is the opinion of this committee that the construction of such laws, as applicable to the transactions of commerce as at present carried on, have been attended with much uncertainty as to the legality of many transactions of frequent occurrence, and consequently been productive of much embarrassment and litigation. 3d, Resolved. that it is the opinion of this committee that the present period, when the market rate of interest is below the legal rate, affords an opportunity peculiarly proper for the repeal of said laws.\"\n\u2014As to the effect of the repeal of these laws, unexceptionable official documents permit us to judge. In the year 1841 the bank of England took the initiative in that regard, and, in a country where it is customary to follow public opinion rather than to lead it, did not hesitate to give an impetus to public thought. On May 13, its court of directors met and embodied the results of eight years' experience in the following declaration: \"Resolved, That the modification of the usury laws at present existing has contributed greatly to facilitate the operations of the bank, and is essential for the proper management of its circulation.\" Parliament, on its side, determined to obtain evidence of the good or bad results of the partial repeal of the usury laws. The house of lords, in the year 1841, investigated the subject, and the testimony brought before it (published in 1845), casts much light on the question.\n\u2014A distinguished economist. Mr. Norman, after having called attention to the fact that the bank of England, thanks to freedom of interest, had successively fixed the rate of discount, following the variations of the market, from 4 to 4\u00bd per cent. on July 21, 1836; at 5 per cent. on Sept. 1 of the same year; at 5\u00bd per cent. on June 20, 1839; and at 6 per cent. on Aug. 1 of the same year; terminated his deposition in these terms: \"I have always regarded with surprise and admiration the way in which the mercantile pressure of 1839 was borne. It was very severe, and the number of failures of consequence was certainly small; and I can not help attributing in some degree the manner in which that pressure was sustained, comparing it with what had occurred on similar occasions previously, such as in 1826, to the state of the law which enabled capital and loanable accommodation to flow into those channels where it was most wanted and could be best paid for\u2014in fact, into its natural channels.\"\n\u2014One of the most eminent practical bankers, Saml. J. Loyd (afterward Lord Overstone), confirmed this opinion by the following explanation: \"Had the law which fixed the maximum rate of discount at 5 per cent. been maintained in operation, it would have produced inconveniences of two kinds: in some cases, parties requiring the command of money would have been unable to obtain it, and would consequently have been subjected to many very serious evils, such as forced sales of their goods at ruinous prices, injury to their general credit, and, in many cases, actual suspension of their payments; in other cases, parties would probably have obtained the money by resorting to circuitous contrivances for the purpose of evading the law, which would necessarily have entailed upon them great additional trouble, discredit and expense.\" Mr. Loyd hence concluded that the act of 1833 had saved British commerce, in the pressure of 1839.\n\u2014This was also the conclusion to which Mr. Samuel Gurney, one of the most able bankers and most revered men in London, finally arrived, who called attention to the fact that in 1818, when the state loans were the only ones exempt from the operation of the usury laws, and when considerable loans had been issued by the government, capital deserted the commercial market, which was subject to the legal limit, for the market of public funds; and commerce had to suffer much in consequence of the restrictions which fettered business. Mr. Gurney entered into detailed calculations which brought into relief the consequences of the two systems of restriction and freedom in the matter of interest. \"The advantages of the relaxation in the law to the trading community,\" he said, \"are that under every circumstance they are able to procure supplies of money and to carry on their business with facility. In the two or three last pressures which we have had, we have had very few failures. I will now take the other side. What is the disadvantage? It is that they have to pay this high interest for a limited time; the calculation of that disadvantage brings it to a very small sum. A firm of large extent may have under discount to the extent of \u00a350,000, and have to pay 6 per cent. interest for that \u00a330,000 instead of 5 per cent. for six months; this is the extent of loss, which comes to only \u00a3250. For that loss he gets the advantage of general facility, a less risk, as credit is much better preserved\u2014advantages greatly beyond the loss. One other great advantage is the ability to borrow money upon the security of his goods, or sell them. If he borrow money upon his goods, it resolves itself into a calculation of a similar character; if he thus borrow \u00a3100,000, there will be a loss of \u00a3300 or \u00a3400; but if he is compelled to sell his goods, he can not, under such circumstances, at a less loss than from 10 per cent. to 20 per cent.; and therefore, on the one hand, he may have to lose some \u00a3300 or \u00a3400; but, on the other, if compelled to sell his merchandise, which he must do were he unable to pay more than the legal rate of interest upon a loan, the loss would be, under forced sales, of from \u00a310,000 to \u00a320,000.\" We might extend these quotations. The witnesses summoned, in the course of the inquiry, were, with scarcely an exception, unanimous.\n\u2014Some persons have observed that, if merchants in high position gained by the repeal of the usury laws, the same was not true of those whose credit was less firmly established, and that usurious rates were demanded of this class. But what does that prove? That there was, apparently, a certain risk in lending. If the usury laws had been operative, the embarrassed merchants would not have found money, or they would have had to pay still more to procure it. In either case, failure was imminent. Thus much for the example of England: let us now pass to France.\n\u2014Interest on money was certainly much higher at the time when legislation interdicted interest loans and burned Jews, than under the far more mild r\u00e9gime which authorized loans under the form of annuities, and fixed by law the rate at which loans could he made by alienating capital in this manner; it had become still lower, and commerce had become extensive at the time when Turgot wrote these remarkable lines: \"It is a well-known fact that there is not a commercial place on the earth where the greater part of the commerce does not depend on money borrowed without alienation of capital, and where interest is not regulated by a simple agreement, according to the greater or less amount of loanable money in the place, and the degree of solvency of the borrower. The rigor of the laws has yielded to the force of things; jurisprudence has been obliged to modify in practice its speculative principles, and people have long since come to openly tolerate loaning by note, discount, and every species of money negotiation between parties. It will always be thus whenever the law prohibits what the nature of things renders necessary.\"\n\u2014The constituent assembly only half adopted the ideas of Turgot. The law of 1789 permitted loans at interest under any form, but it reserved to the legislator the right to fix, or at least to limit, the rate of interest. The civil code, promulgated in 1804, stipulated a similar reservation; these were mere preliminary and tentative changes, which prepared the way for the law of Sept. 3, 1807.\n\u2014We say nothing of the intermediary r\u00e9gime. Some claim that the convention declared money merchandise, and that in consequence of that unlimited freedom, usury for some years invaded and ravaged the country. The laws of the convention were contradictory. At one time, to raise the price of the assignats, it interdicted trade in the precious metals: again, it removed the prohibition and left every one free to buy and sell gold and silver at their actual value. Interest, the rent of capital, only resumed its liberty as a consequence.*28 This liberty was the result of the toleration of the government, and not of a clear perception of a principle which it firmly proclaimed. But what matter is it whether the convention, in removing the barriers it had itself raised, removed also others or not, and rendered homage to political economy without willing it or knowing it? The events which occurred in the commercial world, during that period of anarchy and the disturbed times which succeeded it, prove nothing either for or against any system.\n\u2014We are, however, inclined to believe that, notwithstanding the calamities which were the inevitable result of the civil disorders and of war, and although commerce, manufactures and credit were nearly paralyzed in France from 1793 to 1797, the toleration accorded meanwhile to pecuniary transactions bore more good fruit than bad. People have quoted the protests of some chambers of commerce, which complained at that time of the dullness of trade, the great numbers of failures and the cupidity of loaners. In reply we will say, without having regard to these particular cases, that the speech of Joubert, who proposed the law of 1807, itself shows that interest on money had generally fallen. But, were it otherwise, can any one really suppose that laws more restrictive would have procured money for trade at a low price, at a time when the risks connected with every negotiation or credit transaction were so great, and when confidence was so weak?\n\u2014The legislators of 1804, more favorable to liberty than those of 1807, had left the way open. Article 1707 of the civil code provided that the interest agreed upon might exceed the rate fixed by law, whenever the law contained no prohibition to the contrary. This was directly to recognize that the value of money, like all other values, results from the state of the market and the terms arranged between parties. The legislators of 1807 shut this half-open door, by putting agreed-on rates of interest in the same line as legal interest. It may be well to quote here the language of a law which can serve as a starting point in the discussion. \"Art. 1. The interest agreed upon shall not exceed 5 per cent. in civil matters [i.e., those coming under the cognizance of what are known as civil courts, in France, in distinction from mercantile courts. E. J. L.], nor 6 per cent. in mercantile matters, without retention. Art. 2. The legal interest shall be, in civil matters, 5 per cent., and in mercantile matters 6 per cent., also without retention. Art. 3. When it shall be proven that a loan has been made at a rate exceeding that fixed by Art. 1, the lender shall be condemned by the court before which the case is brought, to restore this excess, if he has received it, or to suffer a reduction of the principal of the debt, and he may even be remanded, if cause appear, to the court of correction, and, in case of conviction, condemned to a fine not exceeding half the capital he has lent on usury. If the result of the law process shows that the lender has practiced fraud, he shall be condemned, besides the above fine, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.\"\n\u2014The economy of the law of 1807 consists entirely in a small number of rules. It lays down as a principle that freedom of agreement in regard to rate of interest must be exercised only within the limit of the legal maximum. Provisionally, this maximum is fixed at 5 per cent. in civil matters, and at 6 per cent. in mercantile ones.\n\u2014The law of 1807 makes usury a crime. But what is usury? Bentham said truly that it was not susceptible of definition. And in fact, if usury consists in loaning at a rate higher than that fixed by the legislature, one may be a usurer in England while loaning at a rate which would be permissible in France, and vice versa. In France the offense depends, not on the nature of the act, but on the quality of the lender. One is a usurer if he loans at 6 per cent. in civil matters, but ceases to be so if he loans at the same rate to one engaged in commerce. These inconsistencies in legislation prove that an attempt has been made to regulate that which, from its nature, evades legal rules. The authors of the law of 1807 perceived this; for, after having made the act of loaning at an interest in excess of the legal rate a crime, they did not affix any penalty. The court, in this case, can only sentence the lender to restore the excess. The sentence can only extend to a fine in the case of habitual usury, that is to say, when the offense becomes changed; when, instead of having to deal with parties whose bargains depend upon the variations of the market, the court finds before it a speculator who makes a business of seeking the most risky investments, those which serve as an excuse or pretext for unlimited profits.\n\u2014The law of 1807 has only one kind of merit. In a country where there is too little general information on matters of political economy, and where anticommercial prejudices have still much influence, it bears a certain relation to the average level of intelligence and the state of morals. In 1836 a motion was made by M. Lherbette aimed at the repeal of this law and the restoration of freedom in the matter of interest; but it failed because of the unenlightened opposition of the elective chamber. In 1850 the proposition of M. Saint-Priest to modify the law had no better success: the law which was enacted Dec. 15, instead of punishing the simple contravention of the law prescribing the legal interest, is only aimed against the habit of disregarding it, and confines itself to increasing the penalties.\n\u2014The law of 1807 governs the trade in money in all the countries of Europe which have adopted or imitated the French civil laws. To examine into the effects it has produced in France, is then to obtain the elements which may serve to give the most general view of the question. The law of 1807 did not, as we know, bring about a fall in the rate of interest, which is, notwithstanding the solidity of the operations, much higher in France, in every scale of credit, than in England, Holland and Belgium. The absolute prohibition it contains has not prevented the loaner, wherever there were risks to be incurred, from stipulating for excessively high interest which was legally usurious. That has been accomplished in a contraband way instead of openly. But the troubles from it have been only the greater; for the interest must include, besides the premium for the risk arising from the small degree of solvency in the borrower, that of the risk arising from contravention of the law.\n\u2014The mohatra, so much branded by Pascal, has reappeared, and the usurious loan has been disguised under the form of a sale. In other cases the fraud has been accomplished under the form of a donation; besides the legal interest, the lender has required a supplementary interest, under the title of gift. Sales with privilege of redemption have also served to conceal usury, which has, besides, taken place under cover of an exchange. But the most usual as well as the most simple form has consisted in stating in the loan contract, or on the notes given to the loaner, a sum higher than that which the borrower had received.\n\u2014The defenders of the system sanctioned by the law of 1807 themselves recognize that this law, far from uprooting usury, has perhaps aggravated it. Usury, it has been said, is devastating French rural districts; and it is certain that the debts of small property-holders had much to do with the socialism of the central and eastern departments of France in 1849 and 1850.\n\u2014A representative of the upper Rhine, M. Cassal, cited in the tribune curious examples of frauds practiced in Alsace to evade the provisions of the law of 1807. \"The usurer,\" be said, \"no longer proceeds in this fashion: 'I lend you one hundred francs in consideration of ten francs.' Nothing like that is written. A note of a hundred francs is made, but only ninety of it are given. Care is taken that it be done with no witnesses present, and then you have the provision of article 1322 of the civil code, which establishes a legal presumption in favor of the creditor who has a writing. In this case itself it is very difficult to prove usury. More frequently sales with power of redemption occur: property is bought for the consideration of one hundred francs, and only ninety are paid; and when the debtor wishes to obtain his property again, he is obliged to pay back the sum stipulated in the contract as price, and happy is he, too, if the purchaser will consent to restore him his property. In this case also, the stipulations of article 1325 of the French civil code are exactly fulfilled: you have no witnesses, and it is impossible to prove usury. When one of these men loans at 5 per cent. on a simple note, there is much reason for mistrust; the lender has evil designs. When the note falls due, the debtor can pay; but the creditor promises to wait. When the time comes that the latter knows the former has no money, he becomes pressing, prosecutes, hounds the debtor, forces him to make an assignment, lays down orders, and, finally, compels the unfortunate to pay what is called the interest of patience. Then he takes everything the former can give: fifty francs, a pair of sabots, a batch of bread, per week. But all this is the A B C of usury. The usurer but rarely makes his bargain in his own name. The borrower sometimes does not even know him; the business is done through an intermediary, a sort of broker, who, ordinarily, has nothing to lose, not even honor, who also takes brokerage, and thus increases still more the interest on the money. When loans are made, the first step is to ask for security. This security is the person who signs the note and carries it to the borrower, or vice versa; the intermediary likewise, signs the note, and it is sometimes covered by three, four or five signatures before reaching the real lender. The usurer is then in the position which, in the language of the law, is called 'a third carrier in good faith.' The aim of the business is to make some kind of a bargain: in primitive times, a trade in flocks or herds; later, in real estate. This is how it is effected. Sometimes one lends a sum, always by an intermediary, on a simple note or an obligation acknowledged before a notary, and on the other hand, he has a field or other real estate sold to him at an extremely low price. Care is taken, however, that the matter be so arranged that the lesion of the seven-twelfths may not be reached. These men, who thus exploit French rural districts, have divided the territory: each one has his chosen portion to exploit, and it is rare for another to permit himself to go there to do business. You comprehend then that they are perfectly well acquainted with the value of the estates, better than the peasants themselves. Consequently there may be usury of 100 per cent. or 200 per cent. without the cognizance of the law. At other times, and this is far more serious and more common, they force the borrower, giving him meantime the funds for the purpose, to buy a piece of land or some other commodity at a very high price. Here they do not take the trouble to put as large a sum as possible into the contract: they put the property at double or triple its value. Let them succeed in making a man contract a debt, and nothing can save him; he is soon dispossessed of his property. I know entire villages which do not contain two solvent private citizens.\"\n\u2014Looking at this social condition, one would think he was living in the middle ages. Is it necessary, in order to remedy this, to make the penalties greater and to increase the legal restrictions? M. Cassal, who is not, however, an economist, but who has had a near view of the evil, does not think so. \"I know the country usurer well enough,\" he said, \"to apprehend that our law (that of 1850) instead of producing the extinction of usury, may perhaps produce the contrary effect, by closing the purse strings and shutting out all credit. Usury is the only means, the single source of credit to the countrymen; and if that source dries up, I fear they may be more miserable than before.\"\n\u2014The defenders of restrictive laws in the matter of interest would do well to reflect upon this remarkable avowal. They think they have replied to all objections when they say: \"If the borrower is not sufficiently solvent for loans to be granted him at the legal rate; if an additional premium is necessary to cover the risk\u2014well, people will not lend to him at all.\" Shall credit be thus obliged to stop rather than exceed the level of interest which the legislator has supposed legitimate? But credit can no more be arrested in society than the circulation of blood in the human body. For the one as for the other, motion is life. You say that loaning at high interest will in the long run ruin the borrower. This is possible; but he will be ruined without usury, if he does not find a way to borrow what he needs to meet his obligations when they fall due!\n\u2014The capitalist who speculates upon the temporary distress of the borrower is a wretch. Science has no intention of sheltering such under her mantle. If usury extends to direct or indirect fraud, there are laws to punish it. But let no one attack the freedom of mercantile transactions, under pretext of preventing usury. Provided the loaner and borrower are free to make a bargain, the contract should be valid. It matters little at what rate the investment be made: the interest of money is naturally subject to one law alone, that which determines that the price of things, instead of being fixed arbitrarily by the civil power, results from the essentially variable relation between supply and demand. There is but one way to abolish usury, and that is to extend to property the benefits of credit institutions, and accustom proprietors punctually to fulfill their obligations. For the rest, the relation of demand to supply so bears upon the contracting parties, that governments, when they wish to borrow, are themselves subject to it. Whenever it was necessary to contract public loans, the French government took good care not to appeal to the law of 1807. In difficult circumstances it has borrowed at 7 per cent. and even at 8 per cent.; and instead of then considering the capitalists who undertook the loan at these high rates as usurers subject to the penalty of the law, it sought to attract them by all means in its power. Not to speak of the profits they have made by loaning to embarrassed governments, have not bankers obtained all the marks of distinction which could flatter their vanity? Have they not been covered with cordons and admitted to the ranks of the aristocracy?\n\u2014Thus the state itself sets the example of violation of the law. It seems that the legal rate of interest is obligatory on every one except itself. To loan at 6 per cent. to private individuals, is to expose one's self to the severity of the courts; to loan at 6 per cent. to the state, to cities, to departments, is to merit public gratitude. Who can henceforth take seriously this pretended crime of usury, which is not such for states, but is such in private transactions?\n\u2014This is not all. In testimony of the powerlessness of the legislator when he attempts to do violence to the nature of things, the French law of 1807 was obliged, in fixing a maximum rate of interest, to admit of exceptions and establish categories. Thus, loans on property security, on pledge, on provisions, and discount, escape its rules. The same observation applies to commissions charged by banks, and to the premium given to brokers who answer for the persons to whom they sell merchandise; as well as to those commercial practices which are so many additions and supplements to the interest stipulated in the money loans.\n\u2014III. LOANS WHICH EXCEED THE LEGAL RATE. The loan on pledge (or pawn), which entails at once numerous risks and considerable expenses of administration, is one of those which can be made only at a relatively high interest. All the pawnbrokers in Europe would be ruined in a few months, if they were compelled to loan at a rate corresponding to the price current of money in the market. The exception which has been made in their favor, or rather, the freedom in regard to interest which is allowed to be the rule in their case, has been favorable to those who patronize these institutions. To speak only of the mont de pi\u00e9t\u00e9 at Paris, the interest asked of borrowers has constantly diminished since the last century: it was 5 per cent. per month in the year III. (1795-6), 2\u00bd per cent. per month in the year VIII. (1800-1), and 1\u00bc per cent. in 1831. As the rent of money becomes lower in the general market of capital, the pawnbroker will lend at a lower interest to necessitous families.\n\u2014As to the loan of provisions, which the law of 1807 does not govern, and in which one may always, by the terms of article 1907 of the civil code, exceed the legal interest, jurists have found a reason to justify that exception, which, if they were disposed, might be made to apply equally well to loans of money. \"How can we think,\" says M. Troplong in his \"Commentary on Loans,\" \"that the legislator could have intended to impose the same rate of interest on loans of provisions as on money? How can we suppose that he would have taken no account of the risks, which are much greater in the loan of provisions than in the loan of money; in the loan of provisions, we say, where an abundant harvest at the time of payment may take away so much of the value of the thing lent in time of dearth? Would he have condemned the system followed in all ancient nations by legislators and economists, of fixing the interest on provisions higher than the interest of money? We think, then, that there would be nothing illicit in an agreement which should obligate the borrower of a hundred measures of oil, grapes, or apples, to repay a hundred and ten or a hundred and fifteen at the following harvest.\"\n\u2014When one borrows money, it is not the metal exactly which one wishes to possess, but the value it represents. Under the form of money or under the form of provisions, the lender delivers capital: capital is the object of the contract. From the essential point of view, which is that of value, there is no difference. In vain has it been objected that the value of grain was variable; for the same objection would apply to the value of money. Who does not know that the power of the precious metals was much greater in the time of Charlemagne than in the reign of St. Louis; in the time of St. Louis than in the reign of Louis XIV.; and in the reign of Louis XIV. than in our day? No doubt money presents a more fixed and certain measure of value from one year to another than wheat; but from one century to another the advantage of fixity and constancy passes to the wheat. The price of cereals is, in fact, the light by the aid of which we find our way in studying the economy of society in the past.\n\u2014Under one form as well as another, the rent of capital depends on its abundance or rarity compared with the urgency of the demand. It is not the nature of the loan which can raise the premium; it is the situation of the borrower. Why did the legislator of 1809 allow the rate of 6 per cent. in mercantile bargains, while he imposed the minimum limit of 5 per cent. in civil matters? Apparently, that difference of interest signifies that the risks are greater in one case than in the other, and that the trader who invests his funds in uncertain operations does not give the same security for payment. Why does M. Troplong recognize in the lender of provisions the right to demand from 10 to 15 per cent. interest, if not because the certainty of payment is less in transactions of that nature? Starting there, to be consistent, one step more should be taken: the principle should be separated from the example, and one should say that the premium on the risk, which is one of the elements of interest, increases naturally in proportion as the certainty of reimbursement diminishes. In loans at interest, the premium on the risk acts as a sort of insurance on capital; this is why there are no reasons for refusing to allow it in the loan of money, when it is allowed in the loan of provisions. Credit is naturally personal. There exists no such thing as one rate of interest belonging to provisions and a different interest belonging to the precious metals. It is because those who borrow provisions generally place themselves in a more hazardous situation, that high interest is demanded of them. But a good number of borrowers to whom money is loaned personally merit still less confidence; why should it not be permitted to stipulate with them a premium for insurance, commensurate with the perilous chances they cause one to incur? The principle is admitted in wholesale contracts. Do you suppose that there is not, as M. Sainte-Beuve has so well said, any such debtor whose solvency makes the loaner run as much risk as he would incur from tempests? To sum up, either the exception made in the case of the loaner of provisions has no raison d'\u00eatre, or the considerations which have determined it tend invincibly to liberty in the rate of interest, under a general law.\n\u2014On the question of discount the subtleties of jurisprudence are freely exercised. Certain jurists rank it in the category of sales; others, in that of loans. \"The banker who discounts,\" says M. Troplong, \"only makes a loan. Accustomed to trade in money and notes, he only purchases a credit; and as 10,000 francs, payable in one year, are not worth 10,000 francs payable now, he gives a less price than the nominal one. This price is calculated on the time to run, on the solidity represented by the signature of the one who signs it, the value of that signature, the place. etc. Discount is only the difference between the nominal and the real value. I have said that the banker buys a credit; I add that, on his side, the borrower buys a present sum for a sum not due. In all cases, the borrower who sells his credit does not contract the obligation of returning the same thing, characteristic of the loan; his obligation is, to deliver the chose and guarantee its payment. On the other hand, the banker becomes proprietor of the effect, with the same title as if he had bought any other article; he uses it as be pleases, and has nothing more to do with the one who assigned it to him except so far as pertains to the security.\"\n\u2014We see that if the rate of discount escapes in France the rules laid down by the law of 1807, it is not through respect to a theory which takes its point of support outside of realities. The legislator has yielded to the force of things, either by formally accepting or by tolerating usages which he could no more modify than destroy.\n\u2014M. d'Esterno has cited, in the Journal des Economistes, curious examples of loans at a high rate, which are negotiated, to the mutual satisfaction of borrower and lender, the department of Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire. \"There are,\" he say, \"small farmers who buy, in May, cattle for labor, and sell them again in November. If they buy them for cash, they pay 600 francs for them, for instance, but, as they only pay 300 francs at the time of getting them, and promise the other 300 at the time when they count on having sold them, they consent to give 50 francs more for that accommodation. This transaction is usual, and it is repeated in the case of other animals, hogs, for example.\" Thus, farmers who would probably not consent to borrow at the rate of 7 per cent. upon mortgage, willingly borrow under that form at 33 per cent. The transaction has no relation to the current rate of interest; but it is within the ability and convenience of the parties who contract. That is sufficient to explain it. Credit institutions, by furnishing circulating capital at lower rates to property owners and farmers, will alone be able to supplant this custom.\n\u2014Contraventions of the law of 1807 are especially frequent, and occur with impunity in civil matters. One has only to consult the notaries to be convinced that, if mortgage loans were confined to the strict limits of the legal rate, there would be to-day, outside of Paris and the range of the capital, few serious and effective loans. By means of accessory agreements, immediate deductions, and various compensations, people succeed, while inscribing only the legal rate in loan contracts, in winning and retaining capital in liens on real estate.\n\u2014As a general statement, it may be said that the only loans which the restrictive laws affect, are the large transactions in which an habitually low price for money renders that intervention at least useless. Those, on the contrary, which escape the action of the legislative enactments, and of the law of 1807 as well as the others, consist of transactions of slight importance and in which a high rate of interest is invariably found to be stipulated. This is true, especially of loans in retail trade and for a short term of credit. Those who loan by the week figure largely in that category. Those who loan by the day are a class of capitalists that should not be forgotten, and who, notwithstanding the high interest they obtain, render real service.\n\u2014\"In the Paris provision market,\" said M. Aubr\u00e9y in his speech against the proposition of M. Saint-Priest, \"a well-known trade in money is carried on: one keeps a shop of five-franc pieces, that is to say, a certain variety of a banker keeps an office in the market and delivers to merchants of the four seasons and to vegetable gardeners a five-franc piece. With this five-franc piece the small trader buys provisions and food which he goes and sells about the city. At the end of his day's work he returns; he has often earned two or three francs with the aid of that five-franc piece. Do you suppose it is hard for him to pay the banker who furnished him the instrument of labor the sum of 25 centimes from his day's profits? * * In this case the interest of the money is 1800 per cent. Some people wished to enter complaint in the name of the law; but the magistrates of the bar of Paris were obliged to recoil before the numerous and incessant cries of the opposition; this resistance derived its strength from the good sense of the people and the benefits of liberty.\"\n\u2014It would seem that an investment by which money brings 1800 per cent. would call in the competition of capitalists, and that this competition would lower the rent of capital. Yet the loans which have taken in the French language the name of \"loans by the little week\" remain at a rate that varies little. The reciprocal advantages of the borrower and lender would not suffice to explain the permanency of so high an interest in these investments. To understand it we must consider the risks to which capital is exposed. The ambulating tradesmen are an essentially nomadic portion of the population: it is the business to which those have recourse, who, for the time being, can do no other, or whose indolence makes them shun labor. From such customers one can not expect great scrupulousness in the fulfillment of their obligations. Five-franc-piece bankers are those who most frequently become bankrupt. The petty dealer, who often spends in drink the day's earnings, consumes both capital and profits. To escape the surveillance and pursuit of the creditor, the debtor has only to migrate from one occupation to another, in the infinite circle of petty trades which spring up and multiply in the streets of Paris. The capitalist lends to strangers, to people who have neither a sou nor a trunk, and without other guarantee than their interest to meet punctually their obligations so as to create for themselves a species of credit, an interest which all do not comprehend. If the debtors were punctual and scrupulous, the creditors, renewing their capital eighteen times a year, would very quickly make their fortune. Many, however, become ruined; and the sphere of these transactions does not appear to enlarge, which proves that there is in them a commingling of good and had chances.\n\u2014And now, I ask, are not the laws which restrict liberty of interest judged, when we see that, for one transaction at 6 per cent. which they prevent in the average sphere of credit, they tolerate or do not prevent a little lower down the scale of loans, numberless public operations every day, in which the usury extends to 1800 per cent. per year?\n\u2014IV. BASIS OF INTEREST. It is time to abandon the historical controversy to examine the foundation of interest. Three principal elements co-operate to determine it: the rent of capital; the premium on the insurance to cover the risk, and, in a great number of cases, the charge for commission; and the salary of the intermediary who puts the borrower in communication with the lender. The rent of capital, the instrument of labor, the motor which sets commerce, agriculture and manufactures in motion, is the principal element in interest. How is its rate determined? and what is its measure? Has this element anything fixed, which depends not on places, time or persons? or must it vary with circumstances and according to individuals? There is, we know, no such thing as unchangeable value; the notion even of value, arising as it does from the idea of relation, implies change. The rent of capital, like the price of all things, must vary under the action of demand and supply; and the law of demand and supply is itself subordinated to all the vicissitudes of production as well as of consumption, not to speak of the influence which progress or decline in means of transportation may exercise. One may not, then, prejudge what the rent of capital should be; but should confine himself to stating what it is. The observation of facts must rule in this matter. No doubt it is recognized in studying the economic history of peoples, that the rent of capital diminishes as wealth increases. But it should also be remarked that, through that incontestable tendency to a fall, the oscillations of interest become more frequent in proportion as commercial relations, developed by increased comfort and intelligence, come to multiply. The rent of capital varies, perhaps, less, in that descending progression, from one century to the following one; but from one year to another, it changes more. Credit, which formerly seemed to have nerves of steel and a hardened epidermis, has contracted the impressionable nature and delicate temperament of the sensitive. One can then determine the rent of capital only approximately, under given circumstances and while these circumstances continue. The system which would make the government regulate the rate of interest, to remain true and not deviate from the facts, would require the rate to be revised each month, each week; and, in some cases, each day; but a rule that required incessant alteration would not be a rule. This system is then condemned either to unchangeability of interest which is contrary to justice, or to an incessant change which would be the negation of law. As to the theories whose pet chimera is a fixed and in some sort normal interest, we will speak of them only to recall a few facts. The bank of France attempted to put them in practice, by maintaining the rate of discount at 4 per cent., in times of pressure as in periods of prosperity; but its resistance was finally overcome: in 1847 it was obliged to raise its rate of discount to 5 per cent. in order to arrest the export of specie; and in 1852, not to remain outside of the business world, it reduced it to 3 per cent.\n\u2014The second element in interest is the tax for insurance or risk. This may be considered as still more variable than the preceding, and is certainly more difficult to estimate. The rent of capital is, as it were, the real part of interest, the part which is regulated by the value of things, the state of the market; and insurance is the personal part. The risk changes not only with the circumstances, but also with the situation and character of the borrowers: it is almost nothing in loans made on bills of exchange or notes payable to order which have several good indorsers; it is considerable in the case of a borrower who gives only his guarantee, and the lender raises the premium for the risk in proportion to the lack of solidity in the guarantee. This weakness of the guarantee may be diminished by the confidence of the lender or increased by his mistrust. This is an element to be taken into account, which, because it is personal on both sides, touches closely upon the arbitrary. \"He who loans his capital,\" says M. Aubr\u00e9y, \"with risk of losing it in whole or in part, renders a greater and consequently better remunerated service than he who loans his capital without risking anything; this is what constitutes the difference between the lessor of real estate and of personal property; because the capital of the one always preserves its identity easy to establish, and is often secured by privileges and mortgages, while, on the contrary, the capital of the other is capable of being consumed by use and absorbed without return, as interest and principal; this is also the difference between the civil and the commercial loan, as well as the loan on pledge (pawn-loan), between obligations on short time and on long time, between maritime contracts and land contracts.\" The extent of the service is not measured by the extent of the risk; but he who consents to loan his capital, without the certainty of recovering it when due, is right in demanding of the debtor a premium for insurance against this danger: this is not a remuneration, it is simply a compensation, a guarantee. But whether remuneration or guarantee, in doubtful cases a prudent creditor would not dispense with this supplement to the rent of capital; yet it is not always sufficient to preserve him from ruin. When M. Proudhon said that the interest of money represented the risk, the chance that might befall, alea, he then exaggerated the truth, he took the part for the whole, he left out of account the very basis of interest, which is the rent capital gives. But even this shows that he took account of one element which all legislation has disregarded.\n\u2014The socialist school, in the theory of gratuitous credit, substitutes for the premium on the risk, a sort of mutual insurance which unites all those making exchanges in the bonds of universal solidarity, and which makes every member of society bear his part in the consequences of the bad speculations or bad chances of all. This is not distributive justice: for the people who offer securities are put in the same category as those who offer none. The socialists make the moral being which they call society intervene in human affairs in exactly the same way as the ancients had their gods engage in them. Society, as they picture it in their romances, distributes subsistence and even wealth to all individuals; all the difference consists in having the manna come from the bank of the people, or the phalanstery, instead of descending from heaven. The people's bank having failed, and the phalanstery having aborted, we have to examine if it is possible, in the ordinary course of transactions, to establish any test or measure whatever of the risk. This element of interest obeys no rules, even for a day, even for a given case; it is an affair of opinion, a question of individual chances. There is nothing in it which one can generalize sufficiently to establish an economic principle, or a legal regulation. The element of risk interposes still greater obstacles than does the element of rent, to any attempt to fix or limit the interest on money.\n\u2014The third element of interest is thus defined by M. Aubr\u00e9y, who, as a banker, could speak from acquaintance with the subject: \"The instruments of labor only reach the laborers through intermediaries; this is the consequence of progress. Capital in the form of money, being an instrument of labor, is as much under the law of division of labor as capital in any other form. As every one knows, capital is put in motion and circulates by the aid of motive agents called banks; labor improves and prospers by reason of the activity and abundance with which capital circulates in these great reservoirs; but every one should also know how much accumulated wealth, moral power and dignity of character is necessary, properly to direct these credit institutions. Now just these rare and valuable qualities, and this difficult and necessary labor in credit institutions, are remunerated by a charge for commission, which increases the interest on the capital furnished. M. Proudhon, in his people's bank, does not contest the legitimacy of this charge; for, when he decreed gratuitous credit, he reserved a discount of from 1 per cent. to 2 per cent. for expenses of administration. Is it possible to determine the measure of this third element? Evidently not. There are credit establishments of different kinds. The banker whose operations extend to millions in a day, takes only a very small commission and yet makes much money, while the petty dealer, who operates only with some thousands of francs, or with five-franc pieces, may charge a very high commission and yet earn but little; though he may give the same measure of his time and labor as the banker.\"\n\u2014The above definition is neither complete nor altogether correct. Although it no more belongs to the government to regulate this part of interest than other parts, we must recognize that this contains an element more easy to estimate and less fluctuating. The institution of banks of circulation and discount has reduced the commission charge to small proportions, wherever their influence extends; yet even the state has a share in it, under the form of the stamp duty it puts on their notes. The commission charge of the intermediary bankers is often blended with the premium for risk: it is thus, for example, at Paris, where a discounter, for giving the third signature, and rendering a commercial bill acceptable at the bank of France, takes a premium or duty of 1 per cent., \u00be per cent. or \u00bd per cent.\n\u2014In analyzing the elements of which interest is composed, we have seen that there is not one which gives a sure basis for estimating it. This has led M. Lherbette to say: \"If you think there is a fixed, invariable basis for interest, why do you make it vary according to circumstances? and if you believe, on the contrary, that its basis is variable, why do you fix upon a rate from which the contracting parties shall not be allowed to vary according to the particular circumstances in which they find themselves and which they will understand better than you? In any case, if you determine to fix it, it will have to be continually modified; for circumstances constantly change; it would be necessary to establish mercurials for money as for bread.\" [The mercurials were registers of the price of grain and some other necessary provisions, and were formerly required to be kept in a public place in the market towns of France. E. J. L.] Even that would not be possible. The tax on bread embraces two or three qualities, of which it fixes the price by consulting the price of grain of corresponding quality; but the tax of interest does not depend on such simple calculations: in its case the rate in the mercurial would have to include as many qualities as there are particular situations, or individuals having recourse to credit. In the domain of credit, the list of classes is infinite: and this will infallibly baffle any pretension to a rule. Freedom in the matter of interest results not less from the powerlessness of the restrictive system than from the right which belongs to the contracting parties to dispose of their property as they think best. The experience of the past is here the most direct auxiliary of principles.\n\u2014It is henceforth a recognized fact, thanks to the intelligence of our time, that interest on money is a legitimate value; why, then, should other conditions be imposed on it than on other values? When merchandise is in the warehouse or brought into market, its price is freely discussed between the buyer and seller; both find this method to their advantage; and the seller would carry away his goods as well as the buyer his money, if any one pretended to dictate to them the conditions of sale and purchase. In the matter of guarantees, both spurn the intervention of the state, and think themselves better off with free competition. Is there the least reason at all serious why trade in money should be excepted from the general law of trade? Sometimes society enjoys a tranquillity favorable to business, while again it passes through periods of monetary pressure in which every enterprise becomes difficult, and the activity of labor seems paralyzed. Money is sometimes scarce and sometimes abundant; the rent of capital must then vary, like any other value, according to circumstances. As to borrowers, they are not all equally solvent: on the contrary, they occupy, according to their morality, their reputation, and the competence they enjoy, various degrees in the scale of securities. Shall one say to a lender: \"Whatever be the state of society, tranquil or disturbed; whatever be the abundance or scarcity of money; whether capital moves in full security or under the pressure of great anxiety; you shall loan your money on the same conditions and to all\"? That would be unjust and absurd; one of two things would inevitably happen: either the prohibition would not be regarded, or capital would be refused, and society would have to manage as it could, to live without credit. Let us change the hypothesis. If a limit may be imposed on the profits of money capital by establishing a maximum rate of interest for money, why may not a maximum be fixed for every species of revenues, all kinds of transactions, and every sort of merchandise? If it is forbidden to lend above a certain rate of interest, why should it not be prohibited to sell above a certain price? The people have a much greater interest in not paying a high price for wheat in time of scarcity, than in finding loans at a low rate of interest. If money capital must not bring its possessor more than a certain per cent. yearly, why should the profit from capital in machines, land or manufactures be unlimited? Suppose I lend my neighbor $20,000, with which he purchases a spinning mill which gives him an annual return of 50 per cent.; why should not I be permitted to obtain what interest I can for my capital, when the borrower who receives this capital from me is free to derive any profit he can therefrom?\n\u2014It is claimed that the interest of money is an exception to the general rules of trade. M. Paillet said that property rights must yield, the same as others, to public utility; and he compared the prohibition to loan above a certain rate, with the interdiction to build within the line of fortresses, with expropriation for the public good, with the prohibition to clear land, with all measures, in short, which society takes to protect the weak against the strong. Political economy does not contest the right of society; but it denies its applicability in this case. What public interest requires the state to regulate the rent of money? We find none. In a theocratic government, where the state is everything and does everything, that would perhaps be conceivable. The priests in that case fix the price of provisions, the form of garments and the number of ablutions. People are not astonished to see them interfere in the system of industries, when they behold their authority reaching even to the domestic hearth. But since the industries have come forth from their swaddling bands, and citizens of the same state can freely trade with each other, it is the interest of each and all that trade in money should be as free as in other commodities. What would the ability to buy and sell products signify, without any other rule than the price resulting from the relation between demand and supply, if capital, which begets the products, were subject to different conditions on the market? Competition determines the rent of capital as well as the price of merchandise; and that alone can bring about and surely will bring about a fall in the rate of interest. Only chimerical or violently-disposed persons demand other methods.\n\u2014The adherents of the doctrine of the balance of trade thought that money, instead of representing the capital in circulation, was the capital itself of each country. This is why they subjected money negotiations to special rules. It was with this feeling that M. Jaubert, who reported the law of 1807, said: \"If commerce gives itself up to speculations in interest, it goes out of its way, and will in the end arrest the progress of industry.\" As if capital, or rather accumulated labor, was intended for any thing else than to serve as a motor, and to procure profits for those who possess it. Communities live by tradition as much as by progress. We increase in stature because we rise on the shoulders of our fathers. Capital prepares the way for labor. The regulation of interest, as we know from the experience of our predecessors, is of no more service to labor than it is to capital. If it makes the latter unproductive, it prevents the former from development. But this system has consequences still more fatal to society than to the individual. It was decreed in France, by the law of 1850, that the maximum interest should remain fixed at 5 per cent. in civil matters. But that did not satisfy either M. Pelletier, who demanded money at 3 per cent., nor M. Proudhon, who aimed to reduce it to zero. The moment the people get the idea that it belongs to the law-making power to determine the rate of interest or to fix a limit to it, we are exposed to all the demands of anarchy. When the people, complaining rightly or wrongly of the hard times, come to demand a reduction in the annual interest, by what right can opposition be made? Will it be said, \"We can not\"? The legislators would then falsify their own action. Will they respond, \"We will not\"? That would be opening the way to revolution. The people would withdraw to the Aventine Hill, claiming abolition of debts; or, perhaps, to avoid paying them, or to pay them in paper money, they will send to the legislature, as certain departments did in 1849, socialistic revolutionists. Regulating interest by legislation is the first step of society toward bankruptcy; for it is the substitution of arbitrary law for the right to make agreements freely.\n\u2014Freedom in the matter of interest is proper for all peoples who have attained their majority and who are governed by laws of their own making: but it is especially appropriate in republics. Where the right of a citizen to take part in governmental affairs is recognized, he can not, without injustice and contradiction, be denied the power to regulate as he pleases his own affairs; to buy, sell, lend or borrow on such conditions as the market offers. The component parts of the sovereign power can not be held in tutelage. It is ridiculous that the law should stipulate for them as for aliens or prodigals put under an interdict. Let them not be called upon to deliberate on the nature and direction of the government, if they are judged incapable of comprehending and defending their true interests; or if that honor is accorded to their independence and intelligence, let the horizon of sovereignty be at least extended to private transactions and the domestic hearth.\n\u2014The United States probably owe some measure of their prosperity to the comparative freedom in the matter of interest. In New York discount has sometimes been taken as high as 18 per cent. per annum. At San Francisco money has been worth 4 per cent. or 5 per cent. a month. What matters it, after all, if those who borrow at this rate employ it so as to make still greater profits?\n\u2014The rate of interest is generally in proportion to that of profits. Where industrial investments bring 12 per cent. to 15 per cent., it would be foolish to claim that one ought to borrow money at 4 per cent. to 5 per cent. The trade in money would, in fact, cease, if it could not take place under conditions similar to those prevailing in other industries. When, on the contrary, capital employed in agriculture and manufactures brings a return of 5 per cent. to 6 per cent., a moderate interest, say from 3\u00bd per cent. to 4 per cent. is generally sufficient for the capitalist. Where the profits from agriculture are considerable, as in many of the western states, the remuneration of labor and of capital is high. Interest is high as well as wages. In Great Britain, on the contrary, where manufacturers, in order to become rich, must operate on immense quantities, the profit being very small on each fraction, capital obtains only a moderate interest. The abundance produced by the treasures accumulated by industry makes capital less in demand there than labor.\n\u2014Harmony of these diverse functions in society can only result from liberty. It is liberty which has caused the growth of manufactures and has given wings to commerce. Liberty can alone regulate the interest of money, to the satisfaction of everybody. Capital can have no other master than itself; and its tyranny will be best avoided by not seeking to reduce it to slavery. A just balance will here arise from the relations naturally established between men and not from the laws they may be tempted to enact.\n\u2014BIBLIOGRAPHY.

When interest represents the sum paid at fixed periods by the borrower to the loaner of capital, it retains its generic name, or takes the more special designation of rent or income. The price charged by the proprietor for the use of land leased by him, is rent. The term income is more particularly applied to the product of capital employed in commerce, agriculture or manufactures. In brief, interest signifies equally the profit the capitalist derives from the direct employment of his capital, and the return he receives for granting its use to others for a certain length of time.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014No difficulty can arise with respect to the profits of a capitalist who employs his own capital: the interest on capital is in this case blended with the product of his labor. If a field be cultivated, or a workshop used by its owner, he has to render no account to any one. The operation is in a certain sense a domestic one, giving rise to nothing requiring regulation. Whether the capital employed by its possessor returns 5 per cent. or 20 per cent., whether it is productive or unproductive, concerns only the producer\u2014pertains only to the proprietor. Nothing in relation to it comes within the province of legislation, which only extends to matters which affect relations among men. But the moment the owner of capital so far relinquishes its use as to lease it, if it be immovable property, or to loan it at interest, if it be movable property, a contract is formed between the one who delivers and the one who receives. From this contract arise rights and obligations for each of the contracting parties, which it is for the law to determine for the advantage of both parties; and consequences also arise from it which it is the mission of political economy to observe, in order to deduce from them, as much for the benefit of individuals as of society, the lessons of experience.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014I. LOANS AT INTEREST. Is it permissible to loan at interest? Can one legitimately derive a product from his capital, a revenue from his money? On this question, which no longer seems to be one, the world, until toward the latter part of the last century, was divided. Loans at interest had in their favor the constant practice of peoples, especially of those noted for their progress in wealth, commerce and industry; on the other side were the oracles of religion and the doctors of the law. Now that theology has become more humane on this point, and jurisprudence has relaxed its rigor, socialism has taken up the thesis of the abolition of interest. The sophism has only changed defenders. Instead of justifying this interference with capital on the ground of charity or in consequence of unenlightened views in regard to morality, appeal is now made to envy and the anarchical passions.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014The (so-called) laws of Moses recognized the legitimacy of loaning at interest, for it was only prohibited the Jews in their relations with their own countrymen, who were considered as members of the same family; and credit transactions with foreigners, as well as commercial ones, were wholly free. The laws of Solon, made for an essentially commercial people, placed no restriction or limit on the employment of money. At Rome, the severity of the legislation on this subject only provoked disobedience. Capital, which was persecuted, became exacting in proportion to the risks to which it was exposed. Nowhere was theory more strangely in contradiction with practice. Cato, who compared usury (i.e., interest) to assassination, was himself an avaricious and pitiless usurer; and the stern Brutus loaned at 48 per cent. per annum.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014In the middle ages the civil and religious authorities were in accord in prohibiting loans at interest. This interdiction, already written in the capitularies of Aix la Chapelle, in 789, was perpetuated in French law until the revolution of 1789. But, during this long millenium, the observance of the legal precept was purely nominal. To evade it, recourse was had to subtleties without number. First the bill of exchange, and afterward the establishment of annuities, furnished the most simple and usual means. Later, people came to tolerate loans by note, discount, and every species of money negotiation between tradesmen. Sovereigns themselves needed to borrow, and were obliged to submit to the conditions of money-lenders. Everywhere the force of circumstances overcame the obstacle of antiquated and anti-social legislation.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014The prejudice against loans at interest may be traced back to the time of Aristotle, and has its source in his writings. The following are the terms in which the Greek philosopher teaches the too-well-known doctrine of the sterility of money: \"The acquisition of wealth being double, that is to say, at once commercial and domestic, the latter necessary and rightfully esteemed, the former not less justly despised as not being natural and not resulting from the sale of commodities, it is quite right to execrate usury, because it is a mode of acquisition born of money itself and not giving it the destination for which it was created. Money should serve only for exchange, and the interest of it increases it, as its Greek name sufficiently indicates. Here the fathers are absolutely like the children: interest is money which is the issue of money, and of all acquisitions, it is that most contrary to nature.\" The anathema pronounced by Aristotle against trade in money, extends, as may be seen, to every kind of commercial operation. He did not comprehend, though living in the midst of people pre-eminently commercial, the utility of the r\u00f4le commerce plays in society. He did not see that to bring nations into contact with each other, to open the ways to markets, to place products within the reach of consumers, was to give them value, was, in a certain sense, to produce them.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014In a treatise aimed against loans at interest, another Greek moralist, Plutarch, exclaims: \"What! you are men, you have feet, hands, and a voice, and you say you do not know how to get a living! The ants neither borrow nor lend; yet they have not hands, or arts, or reason; but they live by their labor, because they are content with things necessary. If people were willing to be content with things necessary, there would be no more usurers than there are centaurs.\" Plutarch here alludes to the rich who expended money in excess of their income, and who ruined themselves by loans contracted to give free indulgence to passing fancies; but, even in those times, the debauchees and prodigals were not the only ones who borrowed. There were already industries which needed capital, and traders who had recourse to interest loans, or loans for a share in the profits to bring their operations to an end or to extend them. The treasures accumulated by saving acquired by commerce, or obtained by victory, were not always dissipated in luxury and in pleasures; they sometimes served to stimulate production and to develop wealth. Money was at that time an instrument of labor. The capitalists who loaned it for that use, rendered service to borrowers and to society. They had consequently a right to receive pay for this service. Plutarch, on account of his preoccupation with the abuses of loans at interest, failed to perceive their good results.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014The fathers of the church who treated this question, only copied Aristotle and Plutarch. \"The lenders,\" said St. Basil, \"enrich themselves by the poverty of others; they derive advantage from the hunger and nakedness of the poor. To take interest, is to gather where one has not sown.\" St. Chrysostom, insisting on this argument, exclaims, in a style loaded with metaphors: \"What is there more unreasonable than to sow without land, without rain, without a plowshare? All those who devote themselves to that damnable agriculture, harvest only tares. * * * Let us, then, cut off these monstrous children begotten of gold and silver, let us stifle this execrable fecundity * * *.\" St. Ambrose, St. Augustine and St. Jerome held the same language. The following is a dilemma of the latter, which, if it is inspired by charity, is hardly so by logic: \"Have you loaned to him who had, or to him who had not? If he had, why loan to him? If he had not, why do you ask of him more, as if he had?\"", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014It is easy to reply that if one loans to those who have, it is because they do not always hold all their resources at their full disposal, and a timely loan of money permits them to await the receipt of their revenues. As to those who possess nothing, by loaning them capital one gives them the means of making their labor productive; one places in their hand the lever of wealth. If they had no credit, they would be still poorer; and they should at least, in consideration of the unexpected good, pay for the use of the money they have borrowed.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014Another doctor in the church, Gerson, the author of \"Imitation of Christ,\" says: \"It is better that there be some light usuries which procure help for the indigent, than to see them reduced by poverty to theft, waste of property, and selling their furniture and immovable property at a very low price.\"", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014The church also condemned sales on time, as a stipulation was made in them in regard to interest on deferred payments. This was, according to the schoolmen, \"to sell time, which can not be sold, since God has made it common to all.\" Strange to say, this maxim of the canon law was first proclaimed by the council of Coventry, in England, the very country where the popular adage, \"Time is money,\" was afterward invented.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014But no one carried the prejudice against loans at interest (which, since the ninth century, had been stigmatized by the name of usury) farther than Luther, the originator of the religious reformation.

To exchange anything with any one and gain by the exchange is not a deed of charity; it is robbery. Every usurer is a robber worthy of the gibbet. I call those usurers who loan at five or six per cent. To-day, at Leipzig, he who loans a hundred florins, asks forty for them at the end of the year as interest on his money. Do you think God will tolerate such a thing? There is nothing under the sun I hate so much as that city of Leipzig; there is so much usury, avarice, insolence, trickery and rapacity there.\"", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014More passion than knowledge entered into the judgment given by Luther. The Roman church had at that time relaxed its severity in regard to loans at interest. Its allies, the Florentines, had become rich by trading in money throughout Europe. In inveighing against bankers, Luther thought he was also inveighing against popes. Calvin showed better judgment, in not allowing himself to be turned from the examination of doctrines by considerations of party or of persons. He vigorously attacked the economic theory of Aristotle on the sterility of money. \"Money, it is said, does not beget money. And does the sea produce it? Is it the fruit of a house, for the use of which, nevertheless, I receive a rent? Is money begotten, to speak properly, from the roof and walls? No, but the earth produces it; the sea bears ships which serve in a productive commerce, and with a sum of money a comfortable dwelling may be procured. If, then, more profit can be derived from money negotiations than from the cultivation of a field, why should not the possessor of a sum of money be permitted to derive from it any sum whatever, since the proprietor of a sterile field is permitted to lease it for a farm rent? And when land is acquired by the payment of money, does not this capital produce an annual revenue? What, pray, is the source of the profits of the merchant? His industry, you will say, and his diligence. Who doubts that money unemployed is useless wealth? He who demands capital, apparently wishes to use it as an instrument of production. It is not then from the money itself that the profit comes, but from the use that is made of it.\" (Calvin's letters.)", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014Doctrines have as much influence as laws on the development of public prosperity. Protestant nations certainly owe to Calvin their superiority to Catholic nations, since the sixteenth century, in commerce and manufactures. Freedom to loan for interest gave rise in them to credit; and credit has doubled their power.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014Not until two centuries later did Montesquieu dare, for the first time in France, to profess the same principles. \"Money,\" says the author of the \"Spirit of Laws,\" \"is the sign of values. It is clear that he who needs this sign should hire it, as he does other things he needs. * * * It is indeed a very kind act to loan money to a person without interest; but we perceive that this can only be a religious precept and not a civil law. In order that commerce be successful, money must have a value. If money has no value, no one will loan it, and the merchant can no longer undertake anything. I err in saying that no one will loan it. The business of society must always go on: usury becomes established, but with the disadvantages always experienced from it. The law of Mohammed confounds usury with interest. Usury increases, in Mohammedan countries, in proportion to the severity of the prohibition. The lender indemnifies himself for the peril of the contravention.\"", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014Montesquieu here, under cover of his criticism of the laws of Mohammed, brings a charge against Christian society. Loaning at interest was still under condemnation in France, both by the canons of the church and the laws of the state, at the time when the \"Spirit of Laws\" appeared. A magistrate could less openly brave that double authority than any other citizen. Hence the artifice of the author. He applies his criticism to the past, or transfers it to the Orient. It is for French society to recognize itself in the picture, if it desires. The following reign relieved writers from that somewhat hypocritical reserve; and political economy, in the writings of Turgot, set forth principles with entire freedom.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014The constituent assembly sanctioned these principles. The law of Oct. 12, 1789, by proclaiming the legitimacy of loans at interest, put an end to a controversy which had been prolonged for twenty centuries: \"All private citizens, bodies, communities and mortmain people\" (i.e., those holding property which they could not alienate) \"shall be able henceforth to loan for a fixed time, for interest stipulated according to the rates determined by law.\" The new law was written, in terms no less explicit, in article 1905 of the civil code, thus: \"It is permitted to stipulate interest for a simple loan, whether of money or provisions or other movable property.\"", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014Since that time loans at interest have been in accordance with civil law in France. Is this likewise natural law? Can reason, based upon the principles of morality and public utility, approve what the law declares? The Catholic church itself no longer contests it. If any are still doubtful on this point, we would refer them to the fine dissertations of the Cardinal of Luzerne and Cardinal Gousset. And as to the jurists who still rely on the arguments of Pothier, they have only to read the learned and often eloquent refutation of them given by M. Troplong, in his \"Treatise on Loans.\" But the thesis which jurisprudence and theology have abandoned, has become a revolutionary commonplace. Loans at interest could find no favor with the socialistic school, which has declared war on capital, and on whose banner is inscribed: \"Property is robbery.\" The theological school, in its arguments against interest loans, showed itself inconsistent. While it forbade the capitalist to collect a monthly or an annual due for the money borrowed of him, it permitted the landowner to lease his land in consideration of a farm rent, and to grant the use of his house to a tenant for a stipulated sum. The prohibition consequently applied to the form of the investment and not to the investment itself. The capitalist was prohibited, not from investing his capital, but from investing it in a certain manner. For lack of having analyzed the nature and having followed in its course the circulation of wealth, and, in consequence, of taking the sign for the thing signified, and the precious metals for value, a sort of embargo was put on money. In virtue of a preconceived theory which represented money as a sterile metal, they really impressed it with sterility.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014It is clear, however, that if the possessor of a sum of money has not the right to make it productive and to derive a revenue from it, the possessor of land could not, with any better right, lease it to a farmer to cultivate, in consideration of an income or rent from it. The earth, in fact, does not spontaneously engender a revenue any more than does money. Under both forms, capital is only the instrument of labor. He who receives it, must pay the price to him who leases it. The borrower owes the price in both cases, or he owes it in neither. There is no way of getting out of this dilemma.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014\"Coined money,\" says M. Troplong very justly, \"the creation of man and not of nature, is in turn utilized as a commodity, or as a sign of values, without there being any reason to cry out against this two-fold employment of it. It must submit to the condition of matter, which is to be a slave of man, and must serve all the uses and necessities that it can reasonably satisfy. So far, then, from disparaging the means of acquisition invented by the genius of man, in imitation of the natural and primitive means of acquisition, we should, on the contrary, recognize that this is the masterpiece of civilization, which opens to social activity new careers, new sources of labor, new and admirable means of promoting comfort among the classes who have inherited no wealth. Plutarch thought he was overwhelming the loaners by an irresistible argument, when he told them that they made something out of nothing. But, without knowing it, he gave the finest eulogy on credit which derives wealth from sterility. Money is no more impressed with infecundity than everything around us; for there is nothing productive for man save what is fertilized by labor or utilized by necessities which pay for their satisfaction. What would the earth produce, save tares and thistles, without the plowshare? What revenue would a house give its owner, if the necessity of a dwelling did not oblige a neighbor to lease it? * * Money becomes productive by the need the borrower has of it, the same as a building becomes productive by the need the tenant experiences of occupying it. Money is sterile only when it remains unemployed. Hence we see the confusion into which the canonists fall, when, granting that money may be made productive by industry, they insist on saying that in interest loans, it is the industry of the borrower, which, keeping the money active, renders it productive, and that, since the lender has no part in that industry, he should have no part in the benefits it procures. But what matters it to the lender what use the borrower makes of the loan? * * It is about as if the lessor of property should have scruples about the legitimacy of his contract because the tenant who rented his house did not occupy it. * * The price the lender receives is not a part of the profit the borrower will make by his industry; it is the price of the transfer which the lender makes to him, for a certain time, of the ownership of a sum that he has declared will be useful to him: a price the legitimacy of which rests on the deprivation the lender imposes upon himself, and on the advantage alleged by the borrower, usura propter usum.\"", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014What M. Troplong here affirms, with general assent, is exactly what socialism denies. \"He who lends,\" says Proudhon, \"in the ordinary conditions of the trade of the lender, does not deprive himself of the capital which he lends; he lends it, because he has nothing to do with it for himself, being sufficiently provided with capital; he loans it, in short, because it is neither his desire, nor within his power, to give it value himself; because in keeping it in his hands, this capital, sterile by nature, would remain sterile; while, by the loan and the interest resulting from it, he produces a profit which enables the capitalist to live without labor.\" (From third letter to M. Bastiat.)", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014That eminent economist, M. Bastiat, whose early loss to economic science we deplore, has remarked that this argument attacks sales as well as loans. If it can be alleged that the possessor of a sum of money does not deprive himself of it, by loaning it, why could we not say the same of the one who sells commodities which he possesses in too great abundance? The system of Proudhon would render every commercial transaction impossible, because there is not a single one which is not based on interest on the capital invested.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014But we do not need to appeal to analogies nor to enter upon comparisons, to refute a theory based on a position outside of facts accepted by everybody, and in opposition to these facts. Let us go directly to the root of the sophism. Socialism claims that the loan should not bear interest while the one who loans does not deprive himself, and that the lender suffers no privation while the capital loaned would remain sterile in his hands. This is an absolutely gratuitous allegation. First, if the capital borrowed must not produce interest, I can not see why the capitalist should part with it in favor of the borrower.

It is surely lawful for him to buy land or a manufactory; and if he does not wish to put his own hand to the work, he can always take an agriculturist or a manufacturer as a partner, invest his funds in a joint stock association, or obtain shares in some marine enterprise or in railroads.

Will the socialists always have eyes only not to see? The earth, from one end to the other of the countries which civilization has touched with its wand, recounts the marvels of capital. Capital is everywhere present. It is the universal motor, the soul of industry; it is the trace of the sojourn or the passage of man on the earth, that which distinguishes culture from barbarism. The power of a people is measured by the extent of its accumulation of labor. A farm in Beance, in France, of the same extent of land as could be bought in Canada or New Zealand for $800, would cost $80,000; and in an uninhabited country it can be had for nothing. Whence the difference in value? From the fact that the land which the colonists buy in New Zealand, for instance, is land yet to be tilled, land without capital; while he who acquires a domain in Beauce pays for the capital incorporated in it.

A state of society in which proprietors who did not cultivate the soil with their own hands should be condemned to give it over, without compensation, to farmers who would derive the benefits of the labor previously expended on it, in addition to the profits from their own labor, would not be long in coming to an end.

RATE OF INTEREST. The legitimateness of loans at interest is to-day recognized in the principal states of Europe. But while abandoning the ground of absolute prohibition, governments have not had the courage openly to avow the doctrines of liberty. Just as it is sought to protect agriculture and manufactures against foreign competition, it is claimed that the cause of the borrower may be defended against the lender, and of the poor against the rich, by fixing the rate of interest or limiting it by the establishment of a maximum. Whoever, in loaning, exceeds this legal rate, exposes himself to a penalty. Usury no longer signifies the interest on money. This word, modified from its primitive sense, takes an opprobrious meaning, and becomes a mark of infamy. To invest one's money at a rate the law discountenances, is called practicing usury, and is to commit a crime.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014The laws which interdicted loans at interest have had their day; the laws which regulate the rate of interest will pass away in like manner. By examining the effects of this legislation, it is easy to show that it defeats its purpose. What is proposed to be accomplished by excepting money from the common rule of values, the level of which is determined by competition in the market? It is desired to prevent the price of that commodity from rising beyond measure, or, in other words, to oppose a barrier to the rise in interest. Now, observation teaches us that the more restrictions the laws have placed upon trade in money, in the past, the higher has become the rent of capital. The penalties against usury give rise to it or develop it; they are an added risk to those naturally connected with investments of capital. In compensation for this additional peril, the lender can not fail to demand a premium. The laws which augment the risk also discourage competition. The number of lenders and the amount of the disposable capital then diminishes, the number and eagerness of the borrowers remaining the same; and people are then astonished at the high price of the commodity, when they have done all they could to produce this condition of the market!", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014In ancient times, the peoples who allowed the greatest liberty in the investment of capital were also those who saw commerce and the industries flourish in their midst, and among whom borrowers obtained the most moderate terms from lenders. The nations, on the contrary, who gave no latitude to credit transactions, or security for credits, were obliged to submit to pay more dearly than others for money. The history of Athens and that of Rome present conspicuous and instructive types of this contrast. At Rome a debtor who did not meet his engagements when due became the slave of the creditor. At Athens the right of the creditor to the person of the debtor was abolished by the laws of Solon. Solon did not attempt to regulate the interest on money, and no trace of usury laws is found in the annals of that commercial republic. The rate of interest at Athens varied according to the circumstances and with the security offered by borrowers. The lowest rate appears to have been 10 per cent.: this was in fact a very moderate charge for movable capital, at a time when the income from land was 12 per cent. to those who did not work their lands themselves, and when maritime commerce, which attracted money as well as men, borrowed at from 20 per cent. to 36 per cent., and when the industries, employing slaves as workmen, returned fabulous profits.

Troplong himself cites from Titus Livy and Plutarch numerous instances which superabundantly prove the contrary. Montesquieu was not in error on this point. \"As the Roman people,\" he says, \"were daily becoming more powerful, the magistrates sought to flatter them by having such laws enacted as were most pleasing to them: capital was restricted; interest diminished and finally prohibited; bodily constraint was taken away; and at last the abolition of debts was proposed, whenever a tribune wished to render himself popular. These continual changes, either by laws or by piebiscits, naturalized usury at Rome; for the creditors, seeing the people their debtors, their legislators and their judges, had no longer any confidence in contracts. The people, like discredited debtors, could borrow only at high rates; and this was the more so, because, though the laws only occasionally interfered, the complaints of the people were continuous, and always intimidated the creditors.

It is sufficient to mention Genoa, Venice, Florence, Holland and England. Holland, in the seventeenth century, although its credit was weakened by war, borrowed at 4 per cent.; in England, the current interest was 3 per cent. toward the middle of the eighteenth century. Owing to their ability to give value to their capital, the Florentines and Milanese, in the sixteenth century, under the name of Lombards, took the place of the Jews, in a large way, and became the bankers of Europe.

Mr. Gurney entered into detailed calculations which brought into relief the consequences of the two systems of restriction and freedom in the matter of interest. \"The advantages of the relaxation in the law to the trading community,\" he said, \"are that under every circumstance they are able to procure supplies of money and to carry on their business with facility. In the two or three last pressures which we have had, we have had very few failures. I will now take the other side. What is the disadvantage? It is that they have to pay this high interest for a limited time; the calculation of that disadvantage brings it to a very small sum. A firm of large extent may have under discount to the extent of \u00a350,000, and have to pay 6 per cent. interest for that \u00a330,000 instead of 5 per cent. for six months; this is the extent of loss, which comes to only \u00a3250. For that loss he gets the advantage of general facility, a less risk, as credit is much better preserved\u2014advantages greatly beyond the loss. One other great advantage is the ability to borrow money upon the security of his goods, or sell them. If he borrow money upon his goods, it resolves itself into a calculation of a similar character; if he thus borrow \u00a3100,000, there will be a loss of \u00a3300 or \u00a3400; but if he is compelled to sell his goods, he can not, under such circumstances, at a less loss than from 10 per cent. to 20 per cent.; and therefore, on the one hand, he may have to lose some \u00a3300 or \u00a3400; but, on the other, if compelled to sell his merchandise, which he must do were he unable to pay more than the legal rate of interest upon a loan, the loss would be, under forced sales, of from \u00a310,000 to \u00a320,000.\" We might extend these quotations.

The authors of the law of 1807 perceived this; for, after having made the act of loaning at an interest in excess of the legal rate a crime, they did not affix any penalty. The court, in this case, can only sentence the lender to restore the excess. The sentence can only extend to a fine in the case of habitual usury, that is to say, when the offense becomes changed; when, instead of having to deal with parties whose bargains depend upon the variations of the market, the court finds before it a speculator who makes a business of seeking the most risky investments, those which serve as an excuse or pretext for unlimited profits.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014The law of 1807 has only one kind of merit.

Cassal, cited in the tribune curious examples of frauds practiced in Alsace to evade the provisions of the law of 1807. \"The usurer,\" be said, \"no longer proceeds in this fashion: 'I lend you one hundred francs in consideration of ten francs.' Nothing like that is written. A note of a hundred francs is made, but only ninety of it are given. Care is taken that it be done with no witnesses present, and then you have the provision of article 1322 of the civil code, which establishes a legal presumption in favor of the creditor who has a writing. In this case itself it is very difficult to prove usury. More frequently sales with power of redemption occur: property is bought for the consideration of one hundred francs, and only ninety are paid; and when the debtor wishes to obtain his property again, he is obliged to pay back the sum stipulated in the contract as price, and happy is he, too, if the purchaser will consent to restore him his property. In this case also, the stipulations of article 1325 of the French civil code are exactly fulfilled: you have no witnesses, and it is impossible to prove usury. When one of these men loans at 5 per cent. on a simple note, there is much reason for mistrust; the lender has evil designs. When the note falls due, the debtor can pay; but the creditor promises to wait. When the time comes that the latter knows the former has no money, he becomes pressing, prosecutes, hounds the debtor, forces him to make an assignment, lays down orders, and, finally, compels the unfortunate to pay what is called the interest of patience. Then he takes everything the former can give: fifty francs, a pair of sabots, a batch of bread, per week. But all this is the A B C of usury. The usurer but rarely makes his bargain in his own name. The borrower sometimes does not even know him; the business is done through an intermediary, a sort of broker, who, ordinarily, has nothing to lose, not even honor, who also takes brokerage, and thus increases still more the interest on the money. When loans are made, the first step is to ask for security. This security is the person who signs the note and carries it to the borrower, or vice versa; the intermediary likewise, signs the note, and it is sometimes covered by three, four or five signatures before reaching the real lender. The usurer is then in the position which, in the language of the law, is called 'a third carrier in good faith.' The aim of the business is to make some kind of a bargain: in primitive times, a trade in flocks or herds; later, in real estate. This is how it is effected. Sometimes one lends a sum, always by an intermediary, on a simple note or an obligation acknowledged before a notary, and on the other hand, he has a field or other real estate sold to him at an extremely low price. Care is taken, however, that the matter be so arranged that the lesion of the seven-twelfths may not be reached. These men, who thus exploit French rural districts, have divided the territory: each one has his chosen portion to exploit, and it is rare for another to permit himself to go there to do business. You comprehend then that they are perfectly well acquainted with the value of the estates, better than the peasants themselves. Consequently there may be usury of 100 per cent. or 200 per cent. without the cognizance of the law. At other times, and this is far more serious and more common, they force the borrower, giving him meantime the funds for the purpose, to buy a piece of land or some other commodity at a very high price. Here they do not take the trouble to put as large a sum as possible into the contract: they put the property at double or triple its value.

It matters little at what rate the investment be made: the interest of money is naturally subject to one law alone, that which determines that the price of things, instead of being fixed arbitrarily by the civil power, results from the essentially variable relation between supply and demand. There is but one way to abolish usury, and that is to extend to property the benefits of credit institutions, and accustom proprietors punctually to fulfill their obligations. For the rest, the relation of demand to supply so bears upon the contracting parties, that governments, when they wish to borrow, are themselves subject to it. Whenever it was necessary to contract public loans, the French government took good care not to appeal to the law of 1807. In difficult circumstances it has borrowed at 7 per cent. and even at 8 per cent.; and instead of then considering the capitalists who undertook the loan at these high rates as usurers subject to the penalty of the law, it sought to attract them by all means in its power.

To speak only of the mont de pi\u00e9t\u00e9 at Paris, the interest asked of borrowers has constantly diminished since the last century: it was 5 per cent. per month in the year III.

Troplong in his \"Commentary on Loans,\" \"that the legislator could have intended to impose the same rate of interest on loans of provisions as on money? How can we suppose that he would have taken no account of the risks, which are much greater in the loan of provisions than in the loan of money; in the loan of provisions, we say, where an abundant harvest at the time of payment may take away so much of the value of the thing lent in time of dearth? Would he have condemned the system followed in all ancient nations by legislators and economists, of fixing the interest on provisions higher than the interest of money?

In vain has it been objected that the value of grain was variable; for the same objection would apply to the value of money. Who does not know that the power of the precious metals was much greater in the time of Charlemagne than in the reign of St. Louis; in the time of St. Louis than in the reign of Louis XIV.; and in the reign of Louis XIV. than in our day? No doubt money presents a more fixed and certain measure of value from one year to another than wheat; but from one century to another the advantage of fixity and constancy passes to the wheat.

It is not the nature of the loan which can raise the premium; it is the situation of the borrower. Why did the legislator of 1809 allow the rate of 6 per cent. in mercantile bargains, while he imposed the minimum limit of 5 per cent. in civil matters? Apparently, that difference of interest signifies that the risks are greater in one case than in the other, and that the trader who invests his funds in uncertain operations does not give the same security for payment. Why does M. Troplong recognize in the lender of provisions the right to demand from 10 to 15 per cent. interest, if not because the certainty of payment is less in transactions of that nature? Starting there, to be consistent, one step more should be taken: the principle should be separated from the example, and one should say that the premium on the risk, which is one of the elements of interest, increases naturally in proportion as the certainty of reimbursement diminishes. In loans at interest, the premium on the risk acts as a sort of insurance on capital; this is why there are no reasons for refusing to allow it in the loan of money, when it is allowed in the loan of provisions. Credit is naturally personal. There exists no such thing as one rate of interest belonging to provisions and a different interest belonging to the precious metals. It is because those who borrow provisions generally place themselves in a more hazardous situation, that high interest is demanded of them. But a good number of borrowers to whom money is loaned personally merit still less confidence; why should it not be permitted to stipulate with them a premium for insurance, commensurate with the perilous chances they cause one to incur? The principle is admitted in wholesale contracts. Do you suppose that there is not, as M. Sainte-Beuve has so well said, any such debtor whose solvency makes the loaner run as much risk as he would incur from tempests? To sum up, either the exception made in the case of the loaner of provisions has no raison d'\u00eatre, or the considerations which have determined it tend invincibly to liberty in the rate of interest, under a general law.", "label": "legislative language; legal citation", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014On the question of discount the subtleties of jurisprudence are freely exercised.

Accustomed to trade in money and notes, he only purchases a credit; and as 10,000 francs, payable in one year, are not worth 10,000 francs payable now, he gives a less price than the nominal one. This price is calculated on the time to run, on the solidity represented by the signature of the one who signs it, the value of that signature, the place. etc. Discount is only the difference between the nominal and the real value. I have said that the banker buys a credit; I add that, on his side, the borrower buys a present sum for a sum not due. In all cases, the borrower who sells his credit does not contract the obligation of returning the same thing, characteristic of the loan; his obligation is, to deliver the chose and guarantee its payment. On the other hand, the banker becomes proprietor of the effect, with the same title as if he had bought any other article; he uses it as be pleases, and has nothing more to do with the one who assigned it to him except so far as pertains to the security.\"", "label": "legislative language; legal citation", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014We see that if the rate of discount escapes in France the rules laid down by the law of 1807, it is not through respect to a theory which takes its point of support outside of realities.

If they buy them for cash, they pay 600 francs for them, for instance, but, as they only pay 300 francs at the time of getting them, and promise the other 300 at the time when they count on having sold them, they consent to give 50 francs more for that accommodation. This transaction is usual, and it is repeated in the case of other animals, hogs, for example.\" Thus, farmers who would probably not consent to borrow at the rate of 7 per cent. upon mortgage, willingly borrow under that form at 33 per cent. The transaction has no relation to the current rate of interest; but it is within the ability and convenience of the parties who contract. That is sufficient to explain it.

The reciprocal advantages of the borrower and lender would not suffice to explain the permanency of so high an interest in these investments. To understand it we must consider the risks to which capital is exposed. The ambulating tradesmen are an essentially nomadic portion of the population: it is the business to which those have recourse, who, for the time being, can do no other, or whose indolence makes them shun labor. From such customers one can not expect great scrupulousness in the fulfillment of their obligations. Five-franc-piece bankers are those who most frequently become bankrupt. The petty dealer, who often spends in drink the day's earnings, consumes both capital and profits. To escape the surveillance and pursuit of the creditor, the debtor has only to migrate from one occupation to another, in the infinite circle of petty trades which spring up and multiply in the streets of Paris. The capitalist lends to strangers, to people who have neither a sou nor a trunk, and without other guarantee than their interest to meet punctually their obligations so as to create for themselves a species of credit, an interest which all do not comprehend. If the debtors were punctual and scrupulous, the creditors, renewing their capital eighteen times a year, would very quickly make their fortune.

BASIS OF INTEREST. It is time to abandon the historical controversy to examine the foundation of interest. Three principal elements co-operate to determine it: the rent of capital; the premium on the insurance to cover the risk, and, in a great number of cases, the charge for commission; and the salary of the intermediary who puts the borrower in communication with the lender. The rent of capital, the instrument of labor, the motor which sets commerce, agriculture and manufactures in motion, is the principal element in interest. How is its rate determined? and what is its measure? Has this element anything fixed, which depends not on places, time or persons? or must it vary with circumstances and according to individuals? There is, we know, no such thing as unchangeable value; the notion even of value, arising as it does from the idea of relation, implies change. The rent of capital, like the price of all things, must vary under the action of demand and supply; and the law of demand and supply is itself subordinated to all the vicissitudes of production as well as of consumption, not to speak of the influence which progress or decline in means of transportation may exercise. One may not, then, prejudge what the rent of capital should be; but should confine himself to stating what it is. The observation of facts must rule in this matter. No doubt it is recognized in studying the economic history of peoples, that the rent of capital diminishes as wealth increases. But it should also be remarked that, through that incontestable tendency to a fall, the oscillations of interest become more frequent in proportion as commercial relations, developed by increased comfort and intelligence, come to multiply. The rent of capital varies, perhaps, less, in that descending progression, from one century to the following one; but from one year to another, it changes more. Credit, which formerly seemed to have nerves of steel and a hardened epidermis, has contracted the impressionable nature and delicate temperament of the sensitive. One can then determine the rent of capital only approximately, under given circumstances and while these circumstances continue. The system which would make the government regulate the rate of interest, to remain true and not deviate from the facts, would require the rate to be revised each month, each week; and, in some cases, each day; but a rule that required incessant alteration would not be a rule. This system is then condemned either to unchangeability of interest which is contrary to justice, or to an incessant change which would be the negation of law. As to the theories whose pet chimera is a fixed and in some sort normal interest, we will speak of them only to recall a few facts. The bank of France attempted to put them in practice, by maintaining the rate of discount at 4 per cent., in times of pressure as in periods of prosperity; but its resistance was finally overcome: in 1847 it was obliged to raise its rate of discount to 5 per cent. in order to arrest the export of specie; and in 1852, not to remain outside of the business world, it reduced it to 3 per cent.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014The second element in interest is the tax for insurance or risk. This may be considered as still more variable than the preceding, and is certainly more difficult to estimate. The rent of capital is, as it were, the real part of interest, the part which is regulated by the value of things, the state of the market; and insurance is the personal part. The risk changes not only with the circumstances, but also with the situation and character of the borrowers: it is almost nothing in loans made on bills of exchange or notes payable to order which have several good indorsers; it is considerable in the case of a borrower who gives only his guarantee, and the lender raises the premium for the risk in proportion to the lack of solidity in the guarantee. This weakness of the guarantee may be diminished by the confidence of the lender or increased by his mistrust. This is an element to be taken into account, which, because it is personal on both sides, touches closely upon the arbitrary. \"He who loans his capital,\" says M. Aubr\u00e9y, \"with risk of losing it in whole or in part, renders a greater and consequently better remunerated service than he who loans his capital without risking anything; this is what constitutes the difference between the lessor of real estate and of personal property; because the capital of the one always preserves its identity easy to establish, and is often secured by privileges and mortgages, while, on the contrary, the capital of the other is capable of being consumed by use and absorbed without return, as interest and principal; this is also the difference between the civil and the commercial loan, as well as the loan on pledge (pawn-loan), between obligations on short time and on long time, between maritime contracts and land contracts.\" The extent of the service is not measured by the extent of the risk; but he who consents to loan his capital, without the certainty of recovering it when due, is right in demanding of the debtor a premium for insurance against this danger: this is not a remuneration, it is simply a compensation, a guarantee. But whether remuneration or guarantee, in doubtful cases a prudent creditor would not dispense with this supplement to the rent of capital; yet it is not always sufficient to preserve him from ruin. When M. Proudhon said that the interest of money represented the risk, the chance that might befall, alea, he then exaggerated the truth, he took the part for the whole, he left out of account the very basis of interest, which is the rent capital gives. But even this shows that he took account of one element which all legislation has disregarded.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014The socialist school, in the theory of gratuitous credit, substitutes for the premium on the risk, a sort of mutual insurance which unites all those making exchanges in the bonds of universal solidarity, and which makes every member of society bear his part in the consequences of the bad speculations or bad chances of all. This is not distributive justice: for the people who offer securities are put in the same category as those who offer none. The socialists make the moral being which they call society intervene in human affairs in exactly the same way as the ancients had their gods engage in them. Society, as they picture it in their romances, distributes subsistence and even wealth to all individuals; all the difference consists in having the manna come from the bank of the people, or the phalanstery, instead of descending from heaven. The people's bank having failed, and the phalanstery having aborted, we have to examine if it is possible, in the ordinary course of transactions, to establish any test or measure whatever of the risk. This element of interest obeys no rules, even for a day, even for a given case; it is an affair of opinion, a question of individual chances. There is nothing in it which one can generalize sufficiently to establish an economic principle, or a legal regulation. The element of risk interposes still greater obstacles than does the element of rent, to any attempt to fix or limit the interest on money.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014The third element of interest is thus defined by M. Aubr\u00e9y, who, as a banker, could speak from acquaintance with the subject: \"The instruments of labor only reach the laborers through intermediaries; this is the consequence of progress. Capital in the form of money, being an instrument of labor, is as much under the law of division of labor as capital in any other form. As every one knows, capital is put in motion and circulates by the aid of motive agents called banks; labor improves and prospers by reason of the activity and abundance with which capital circulates in these great reservoirs; but every one should also know how much accumulated wealth, moral power and dignity of character is necessary, properly to direct these credit institutions. Now just these rare and valuable qualities, and this difficult and necessary labor in credit institutions, are remunerated by a charge for commission, which increases the interest on the capital furnished. M. Proudhon, in his people's bank, does not contest the legitimacy of this charge; for, when he decreed gratuitous credit, he reserved a discount of from 1 per cent. to 2 per cent. for expenses of administration. Is it possible to determine the measure of this third element? Evidently not. There are credit establishments of different kinds. The banker whose operations extend to millions in a day, takes only a very small commission and yet makes much money, while the petty dealer, who operates only with some thousands of francs, or with five-franc pieces, may charge a very high commission and yet earn but little; though he may give the same measure of his time and labor as the banker.\"", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014The above definition is neither complete nor altogether correct. Although it no more belongs to the government to regulate this part of interest than other parts, we must recognize that this contains an element more easy to estimate and less fluctuating. The institution of banks of circulation and discount has reduced the commission charge to small proportions, wherever their influence extends; yet even the state has a share in it, under the form of the stamp duty it puts on their notes. The commission charge of the intermediary bankers is often blended with the premium for risk: it is thus, for example, at Paris, where a discounter, for giving the third signature, and rendering a commercial bill acceptable at the bank of France, takes a premium or duty of 1 per cent., \u00be per cent. or \u00bd per cent.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014In analyzing the elements of which interest is composed, we have seen that there is not one which gives a sure basis for estimating it. This has led M. Lherbette to say: \"If you think there is a fixed, invariable basis for interest, why do you make it vary according to circumstances? and if you believe, on the contrary, that its basis is variable, why do you fix upon a rate from which the contracting parties shall not be allowed to vary according to the particular circumstances in which they find themselves and which they will understand better than you? In any case, if you determine to fix it, it will have to be continually modified; for circumstances constantly change; it would be necessary to establish mercurials for money as for bread.\" [The mercurials were registers of the price of grain and some other necessary provisions, and were formerly required to be kept in a public place in the market towns of France. E. J. L.] Even that would not be possible. The tax on bread embraces two or three qualities, of which it fixes the price by consulting the price of grain of corresponding quality; but the tax of interest does not depend on such simple calculations: in its case the rate in the mercurial would have to include as many qualities as there are particular situations, or individuals having recourse to credit. In the domain of credit, the list of classes is infinite: and this will infallibly baffle any pretension to a rule. Freedom in the matter of interest results not less from the powerlessness of the restrictive system than from the right which belongs to the contracting parties to dispose of their property as they think best. The experience of the past is here the most direct auxiliary of principles.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014It is henceforth a recognized fact, thanks to the intelligence of our time, that interest on money is a legitimate value; why, then, should other conditions be imposed on it than on other values? When merchandise is in the warehouse or brought into market, its price is freely discussed between the buyer and seller; both find this method to their advantage; and the seller would carry away his goods as well as the buyer his money, if any one pretended to dictate to them the conditions of sale and purchase. In the matter of guarantees, both spurn the intervention of the state, and think themselves better off with free competition. Is there the least reason at all serious why trade in money should be excepted from the general law of trade? Sometimes society enjoys a tranquillity favorable to business, while again it passes through periods of monetary pressure in which every enterprise becomes difficult, and the activity of labor seems paralyzed. Money is sometimes scarce and sometimes abundant; the rent of capital must then vary, like any other value, according to circumstances. As to borrowers, they are not all equally solvent: on the contrary, they occupy, according to their morality, their reputation, and the competence they enjoy, various degrees in the scale of securities. Shall one say to a lender: \"Whatever be the state of society, tranquil or disturbed; whatever be the abundance or scarcity of money; whether capital moves in full security or under the pressure of great anxiety; you shall loan your money on the same conditions and to all\"? That would be unjust and absurd; one of two things would inevitably happen: either the prohibition would not be regarded, or capital would be refused, and society would have to manage as it could, to live without credit. Let us change the hypothesis. If a limit may be imposed on the profits of money capital by establishing a maximum rate of interest for money, why may not a maximum be fixed for every species of revenues, all kinds of transactions, and every sort of merchandise? If it is forbidden to lend above a certain rate of interest, why should it not be prohibited to sell above a certain price? The people have a much greater interest in not paying a high price for wheat in time of scarcity, than in finding loans at a low rate of interest. If money capital must not bring its possessor more than a certain per cent. yearly, why should the profit from capital in machines, land or manufactures be unlimited? Suppose I lend my neighbor $20,000, with which he purchases a spinning mill which gives him an annual return of 50 per cent.; why should not I be permitted to obtain what interest I can for my capital, when the borrower who receives this capital from me is free to derive any profit he can therefrom?", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014It is claimed that the interest of money is an exception to the general rules of trade.

Political economy does not contest the right of society; but it denies its applicability in this case. What public interest requires the state to regulate the rent of money? We find none. In a theocratic government, where the state is everything and does everything, that would perhaps be conceivable. The priests in that case fix the price of provisions, the form of garments and the number of ablutions. People are not astonished to see them interfere in the system of industries, when they behold their authority reaching even to the domestic hearth. But since the industries have come forth from their swaddling bands, and citizens of the same state can freely trade with each other, it is the interest of each and all that trade in money should be as free as in other commodities. What would the ability to buy and sell products signify, without any other rule than the price resulting from the relation between demand and supply, if capital, which begets the products, were subject to different conditions on the market?

Communities live by tradition as much as by progress. We increase in stature because we rise on the shoulders of our fathers. Capital prepares the way for labor. The regulation of interest, as we know from the experience of our predecessors, is of no more service to labor than it is to capital. If it makes the latter unproductive, it prevents the former from development. But this system has consequences still more fatal to society than to the individual. It was decreed in France, by the law of 1850, that the maximum interest should remain fixed at 5 per cent. in civil matters. But that did not satisfy either M. Pelletier, who demanded money at 3 per cent., nor M. Proudhon, who aimed to reduce it to zero. The moment the people get the idea that it belongs to the law-making power to determine the rate of interest or to fix a limit to it, we are exposed to all the demands of anarchy. When the people, complaining rightly or wrongly of the hard times, come to demand a reduction in the annual interest, by what right can opposition be made? Will it be said, \"We can not\"? The legislators would then falsify their own action. Will they respond, \"We will not\"? That would be opening the way to revolution. The people would withdraw to the Aventine Hill, claiming abolition of debts; or, perhaps, to avoid paying them, or to pay them in paper money, they will send to the legislature, as certain departments did in 1849, socialistic revolutionists. Regulating interest by legislation is the first step of society toward bankruptcy; for it is the substitution of arbitrary law for the right to make agreements freely.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014Freedom in the matter of interest is proper for all peoples who have attained their majority and who are governed by laws of their own making: but it is especially appropriate in republics. Where the right of a citizen to take part in governmental affairs is recognized, he can not, without injustice and contradiction, be denied the power to regulate as he pleases his own affairs; to buy, sell, lend or borrow on such conditions as the market offers. The component parts of the sovereign power can not be held in tutelage. It is ridiculous that the law should stipulate for them as for aliens or prodigals put under an interdict. Let them not be called upon to deliberate on the nature and direction of the government, if they are judged incapable of comprehending and defending their true interests; or if that honor is accorded to their independence and intelligence, let the horizon of sovereignty be at least extended to private transactions and the domestic hearth.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014The United States probably owe some measure of their prosperity to the comparative freedom in the matter of interest. In New York discount has sometimes been taken as high as 18 per cent. per annum. At San Francisco money has been worth 4 per cent. or 5 per cent. a month. What matters it, after all, if those who borrow at this rate employ it so as to make still greater profits?", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014The rate of interest is generally in proportion to that of profits. Where industrial investments bring 12 per cent. to 15 per cent., it would be foolish to claim that one ought to borrow money at 4 per cent. to 5 per cent. The trade in money would, in fact, cease, if it could not take place under conditions similar to those prevailing in other industries. When, on the contrary, capital employed in agriculture and manufactures brings a return of 5 per cent. to 6 per cent., a moderate interest, say from 3\u00bd per cent. to 4 per cent. is generally sufficient for the capitalist. Where the profits from agriculture are considerable, as in many of the western states, the remuneration of labor and of capital is high. Interest is high as well as wages. In Great Britain, on the contrary, where manufacturers, in order to become rich, must operate on immense quantities, the profit being very small on each fraction, capital obtains only a moderate interest. The abundance produced by the treasures accumulated by industry makes capital less in demand there than labor.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014Harmony of these diverse functions in society can only result from liberty. It is liberty which has caused the growth of manufactures and has given wings to commerce. Liberty can alone regulate the interest of money, to the satisfaction of everybody. Capital can have no other master than itself; and its tyranny will be best avoided by not seeking to reduce it to slavery. A just balance will here arise from the relations naturally established between men and not from the laws they may be tempted to enact.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "\u2014BIBLIOGRAPHY.

Both the Pull and Nykerk are competitions between members of the freshman and sophomore classes. The Pull marked its 115th year earlier this fall. Nykerk, a Hope tradition since 1936, will be held on Saturday, Nov. 3, as part of Parents Weekend. Over the years The Pull in particular has found its way into the national and even international media, from The Guinness Book of World Records (1995) to Sports Illustrated (twice--in 1966 and 1996); from a magazine in Japan (1983) to Australian television (1996).\nBook Descriptive from Mississippi Press\nFrom their beginnings, campuses emerged as hotbeds of traditions and folklore. American college students inhabit a culture with its own slang, stories, humor, beliefs, rituals, and pranks. Simon J. Bronner takes a long, engaging look at American campus life and how it is shaped by students and at the same time shapes the values of all who pass through it. The archetypes of absent-minded profs, fumbling jocks, and curve-setting dweebs are the stuff of legend and humor, along with the all-nighters, tailgating parties, and initiations that mark campus tradition--and student identities. Undergraduates in their hallowed halls embrace distinctive traditions because the experience of higher education precariously spans childhood and adulthood, parental and societal authority, home and corporation, play and work.\nBronner traces historical changes in these traditions. The predominant context has shifted from what he calls the \"old-time college,\" small in size and strong in its sense of community, to mass society's \"mega-university,\" a behemoth that extends beyond any campus to multiple branches and offshoots throughout a state, region, and sometimes the globe. One might assume that the mega-university has dissolved collegiate traditions and displaced the old-time college, but Bronner finds the opposite. Student needs for social belonging in large universities and a fear of losing personal control have given rise to distinctive forms of lore and a striving for retaining the pastoral \"campus feel\" of the old-time college. The folkloric material students spout, and sprout, in response to these needs is varied but it is tied together by its invocation of tradition and social purpose. Beneath the veil of play, students work through tough issues of their age and environment. They use their lore to suggest ramifications, if not resolution, of these issues for themselves and for their institutions. In the process, campus traditions are keys to the development of American culture.\nMississippi Press Website", "id": "<urn:uuid:03d1770a-c70c-4d27-b743-df444db70890>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://hope.edu/2012/10/11/longtime-hope-traditions-featured-book", "date": "2013-05-20T11:46:26Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368698924319/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516100844-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9469917416572571, "token_count": 618}, "content": [{"line": "Two longtime Hope College traditions -- The Pull tug-of-war and the Nykerk Cup competition -- are included in a book, \"Campus Traditions: Folklore from the Old-Time College to the Modern Mega-University\" by Simon J.

{"doc": {"text": "Rebecca Roberts questions the use of language in criminal justice and introduces comments from Frances Crook, Jonathan Simon, Mike Nellis, Lizzie Seal, Simon Pemberton and Nils Christie\nThe proliferation of \u2018criminal justice talk\u2019 \u2013 the number of words that are spoken and written about \u2018crime\u2019 and \u2018criminal justice\u2019 \u2013 in politics, media outlets, academia, and public policy is ever increasing and ever more widely accessible. This \u2018debating\u2019 section attempts to kick off a discussion about the use of criminal justice language which we can hopefully continue within the pages of cjm as well as through our Works for Freedom website.\nThe idea for this came from discussions at the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies about the language we use in our day-to-day work. Whether it is drafting a strategic plan or funding application, writing up research or, indeed, editing cjm , we have to think carefully about language in the communication of ideas and engaging in public debate. At one level, it should be easy \u2013 just say what you see and do it in simple and easily understood terms. However, this is more challenging when attempting to foster critical thinking about issues relating to crime and justice. In an arena so dominated by stereotypes, prejudices, and mystification about how the system operates and who or what it targets, it seemed relevant to open up a discussion on this. So, we approached a number of writers to ask for their views.\nFrances Crook, Jonathan Simon, and Mike Nellis look at the uses and abuses of the term \u2018offender\u2019. Crook argues that the label is demeaning and counterproductive and calls on the voluntary sector to lead the way in challenging the use of language about people caught up in the criminal justice system. Jonathan Simon is also critical of the term \u2018offender\u2019 and takes issue with describing people by one aspect of their behaviour and discusses some alternatives. Mike Nellis defends the use of \u2018offender\u2019 in probation practice and highlights its popularisation in the 1960s as an alternative to terms such as \u2018criminal\u2019 and \u2018delinquent\u2019. Nellis argues that \u2018treating people with respect and dignity regardless of what they have done, and finding words to match, is always important, but not necessarily straightforward\u2019.\nLizzie Seal looks at representations of women accused of murder and how they are often framed in terms of \u2018perverse\u2019 sexuality in a bid to emphasise their apparent deviation from the \u2018norm\u2019. Nils Christie and Simon Pemberton look at crime and harm. Christie highlights the increasing number of acts that are defined as criminal and the negative impact of social isolation and distance in terms of framing behaviour and actions, and how they are subsequently interpreted and dealt with. Simon Pemberton argues that we should look beyond individual acts and \u2018offences\u2019 and use a social harm approach to interpret and interrogate social structures and how they create and reproduce harm.\nIt would be difficult to institute timeless and unchanging rules about what language can and cannot be used. New terms that may seem value free can soon become coopted and value laden. The popularity of words and phrases will shift over time \u2013 for good and bad. In reflecting on the discussion in the debating section, the message that comes through is the importance of being searching and reflective in our use of language.\nIn conclusion, I offer three possible things to consider when engaging in discussion and debate about criminal justice. The first is the human aspect \u2013 remembering at all times that when we talk about offenders, victims, deviants, criminals, or research subjects \u2013 all are human beings first. Secondly, it is important to encourage accuracy in defining our terms of reference. For example, there is a strong tendency towards talking about crime and criminal justice in very loose terms. Are we talking about all illegal acts? If not, which ones are we particularly interested in, and why? Those that come to the attention of the police? Are we talking about shoplifting or sexual assault or widespread harmful and illegal practices of the banking sector? When we talk about \u2018offenders\u2019, who and what are we talking about? The final point is about how best to foster and encourage critical understanding \u2013 thinking critically about the implications of using certain terms and the assumptions underlying them. Viewing certain social \u2018problems\u2019 through a \u2018crime\u2019 lens tends to imply the criminal justice system as the primary mechanism through which certain social \u2018problems\u2019 are viewed and dealt with.\nExploring and debating definitions is more than a merely \u2018academic\u2019 exercise. From an early age we are given words and labels to describe the world around us. They are important tools to help interpret and explain our surroundings and feelings \u2013 the concrete and abstract. At one level, a common sense approach of using language that those around us understand needs no explanation. But, the words and phrases we use contain signals about gender, class, power, and the nature of social relations. If we want to understand criminal justice it is also important to understand the way in which the public discourse about it is constructed \u2013 and to encourage reflective and critical discussion.\nThis is not a call for stripping away meaning from words. As emphasised by Stan Cohen (1985) in studying the professional discourse around social control, he calls for an exploration of what he describes as \u2018Controltalk\u2019 \u2013 and warns against overly sanitising the language we use. Making coercive interventions sound non-coercive and \u2018nice\u2019, it can help to obscure the harsh realities of confinement and control. But ultimately, the point is to be careful in our use of language, because as Cohen argues, \u2018such a project of self awareness might help to clarify the moral, tactical and political choices in working out a policy\u2026 I would always prefer a form of justice in which values, conflicts and injustices become open and visible\u2019 (Cohen, 1985).\nIt's not so much the words themselves that are good or bad. It is their meaning and associations that matter. Social problems exist as do the people that experience them \u2013 how we name and frame these problems and the people involved is important and should be at the forefront of our thinking when engaging in research, policy, and public debate.\nLabelling people as offenders is demeaning and counter-productive\nby Frances Crook\nA summer article in The Guardian reported on recent research from the UK Drugs Policy Commission that the use of stigmatising terms such as \u2018junkie\u2019 was a major obstacle to recovery for problem drug users. This can hardly be a surprise to anyone who has worked with people with any sort of health, mental health, or social problem, however, it may be a revelation to politicians. For too long it is has been easy for politicians to treat certain sections of the population as \u2018other\u2019, implying that they are less than human. Insulting labels that define the action or illness as if it defines the whole person inhibit that individual from confronting the problem and moving on; just as importantly, the label prevents us from understanding as it becomes all we see.\nThe Howard League conducted in-depth interviews with young adults in prison a few years ago, and they told us clearly that the first step towards a crime-free life was no longer to be labelled an offender. They had to see themselves as something different, and other people had to help them make that transition.\nSomeone who commits an offence is not an offender; they are someone who has done something. The action does not define the whole person. They may also do good things and they will certainly fit into other categories that can offer a different definition like parent or friend. By insisting that the offence overcomes all other parts of the person we are condemning them to a sub-human category for whom there is no hope.\nThe last government created a whole industry of services for offenders. There are skills for offenders, education for offenders, and work for offenders. Huge numbers of people are employed to deliver services at these unfortunate people. Of course, it was part of the scheme of things that offenders are not deserving of having any say in the quality or style of services, as they have had their citizenship diluted to the point of abstraction.\nIt is time to move away from this so that the criminal justice system itself and its terminology are circumscribed. People who have committed offences have just the same right to education and employment as anyone else, and whilst they do face additional and sometimes extraordinary challenges, redressing that should simply be built into all mainstream provision.\nJust as the language about disability has been transformed and services have been adapted to include people with disabilities, so our language about people who have committed offences must change. It is up to the voluntary sector to lead the way.\nA strategy for writing in criminology and law and society work\nby Jonathan Simon\nAnyone writing in criminology or law and society scholarship in the post labelling/Foucault generations is generally haunted by the problem of what to call the subjects of criminal justice processing and punishment (as you can see I'm fighting myself to delay the moment when it becomes incumbent). We know that when we move from an adjective for conduct to using that adjective for the name of the subjects we are associating with that conduct (whether by legal or scientific procedure) we are producing a potentially consequential \u2018truth effect\u2019 that we are, however modestly involved in what Ian Hacking memorably called \u2018making people up\u2019.\nThe two most famous/infamous are criminal and homosexual. To take the latter first, the move from describing sexual conduct as \u2018homosexual\u2019, meaning between two people of the same sex, to talking about \u2018homosexuals\u2019 involves the assumption that the conduct defines a constitutive characteristic of the subject involved such that whether that person is an out Gay man engaged in full and open life within a big city Gay community, or a married Tory minister involved in an occasional and discrete liaison with a handsome young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, there is a continuity of character strong enough to be the defining identity of that person. When we move from describing conduct as \u2018criminal\u2019 to speaking of a person as a \u2018criminal\u2019, we are likewise assuming a sovereign character trait that can be traced into the subject's developmental past, and used to predict their future behaviour.\nThe fact that many and probably most contemporary social scientists would feel uncomfortable making this kind of transfer of meaning is a dramatic shift from the early and even mid-twentieth century forms of social science. It divides us from our ancestors who felt their job was making people up correctly (think about Lombroso as well as his competitors) and it is a tremendous legacy for the generation of scholars that included Michel Foucault, David Matza, Howard Becker, and Jeffrey Weeks just to name a few. Yet, many of us do it in language.\nThe solution, promoted for years now by activists and lawyers is to talk about \u2018people engaged in homosexual conduct\u2019 or \u2018people engaged in criminal conduct\u2019. This works fine enough conceptually, but it leaves us with a writing problem. Using the formulation, \u2018people engaged in criminal conduct\u2019 over and over again, in an article about people who commit crimes, is wearying. Since I do not see a good conceptual way out of this problem, I prefer to adopt some writing strategies. Since \u2018people\u2019 or \u2018men\u2019 or \u2018women\u2019 etc. \u2018engaged in criminal conduct\u2019 deconstructs the very idea of a \u2018criminal type\u2019, it buys us some freedom to use other words for literary benefit, so long as we are careful not to choose words that affirmatively mystify but reinvesting in the made up subject of crime. Thus it seems fine to me to refer to \u2018defendants\u2019, \u2018convicts\u2019, or \u2018prisoners\u2019, when those more or less legal terms appropriately apply (throw in arrestee, detainee).\nUnlike the dreaded \u2018al\u2019 terms, terms ending in \u2018ts\u2019 or \u2018rs\u2019 are a well know and comfortable way of referring to people by their \u2018occupations\u2019. We talk about lawyers, doctors, dentists, and bankers at will, without fear we are making subjects up. Our culture retains the sense that one's occupation is an important but not defining source of identity. The productive sociological notion of a \u2018career\u2019 once again recommends this. We can think of someone's time in prison, or time engaged in criminal behaviour, as a part of a career in the sense of a body of experience that helps to structure their future but does not determine it.\nUsing language in practice\nby Mike Nellis\nWhen the term \u2018offender\u2019 was popularised by Nacro (the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders) in the 1960s it was talked up on the understanding that it was less moralistic and less stigmatising than \u2018criminal\u2019 or \u2018delinquent\u2019, less portentous than \u2018lawbreaker\u2019 and less condescending than \u2018probationer\u2019. It wasn't new, but of the limited range of words around, it was relatively neutral in its connotations. It has remained surprisingly serviceable in this respect, relatively immune to the infusions of loathing and contempt that can indeed poison our penal vocabularies. The tabloids rarely use it; except when prefaced by \u2018sex\u2019, it's not a term that's easily freighted with outrage or hate. Like \u2018prisoner\u2019 (which has never been fully displaced by the euphemism \u2018inmate\u2019) \u2018offender\u2019 has retained a simple literal meaning \u2013 someone who has committed an offence. As such, it provides minimal linguistic justification for the formal, court-ordered involvement of a probation officer in a person's life, in a way that both the old term \u2018client\u2019 and the newer term \u2018service user\u2019 shy away from.\nFrom a probation standpoint, no one is ever an \u2018offender\u2019 and nothing more. It denotes what people are, not just what they do, but it's not a totalising identity. Other facets of their lives and personalities can remain in play around and alongside it \u2013 father, daughter, partner, comedian, mate, cook, dancer, builder, whatever \u2013 all as much if not more important than the often temporary status of \u2018offender\u2019. To consider, or even call, someone an \u2018offender\u2019 does not intrinsically preclude thinking of them as a complex and vulnerable person or feeling warmly or respectful towards them. It does not necessarily impede empathy or limit one's capacity to imagine what it might be like to be them, or even to imagine doing what they have done \u2013 though that does depend somewhat on what the offence was. It need not mean that someone who has offended may not also be, or have been, a victim or survivor.\nTreating people with respect and dignity regardless of what they have done, and finding words to match, is always important, but not necessarily straightforward. Sentimentality and the anodyne, sanitising language that goes with it is as much to be avoided as the moralism which insidiously humiliates and imprisons people in roles and identities from which they need to distance themselves if they are to live good lives. There are probably no words that are entirely immune from debasement in some form or context \u2013 and some words that probation has toyed with, like \u2018perpetrator\u2019, were doomed from the start \u2013 but for now \u2018offender\u2019 retains its utility in the complex \u2018identity work\u2019 that probation officers do with people who have committed crimes.\nDifferent people need different responses. Some who come the way of probation shamelessly disavow criminal identities \u2013 rapist, for example \u2013 and need pressing to accept that aspect of who they are, as a precursor to taking responsibility for harm done. Others spend lifetimes sombrely regretting that they once committed murder, indelibly stained in their own eyes. Yet others may never have had \u2013 or had and rejected \u2013 conventional familial or occupational identities, and actually draw strength and purpose from an overriding criminal, sometimes violent, identity, preferring to be more feared than loved. They may resent and disdain the efforts of well-meaning probation officers to get them to think differently about themselves, and even if they do desist, may never fully repudiate what they have been in the past \u2013 anymore than the rest of us can. One can be an \u2018ex-offender\u2019 (or even an \u2018ex-con\u2019) without losing self-respect.\nWomen, murder and narratives of femininity\nby Lizzie Seal\nThe language used to portray women accused of murder is frequently lurid and stereotypical. It can be especially shocking when women stand accused of such crimes as it violates idealised notions of femininity as conformist and nurturing. A recent example is the fascination sparked by the trial and conviction of Amanda Knox, a young American woman, for the sexual assault and murder of British exchange student, Meredith Kercher, in Perugia, Italy. Meredith was killed in 2007, although the convictions of Amanda and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were not secured until 2009. A story about Amanda Knox posted on the Daily Mail's website describes her as having a \u2018wild, raunchy past\u2019, which included drinking and soft drug use, and quotes university acquaintances who label her a \u2018man-eater\u2019. Amanda's supposed sexual insatiability was also central to the Italian prosecution's argument that she stabbed Meredith to death after Meredith refused to participate in a sex game with Raffaele and another man, Rudy Guede.\nThe perceived link between abnormal or excessive sexuality in women and a capacity for violence is an enduring one. Martha Beck and her boyfriend, Raymond Fernandez, were executed in New York in 1951 for murdering two women and a child. They were known as the \u2018Lonely Hearts Killers\u2019 because they found their victims through the personal ads. Important to the trial was Martha's argued sexual perversity, evidenced by her enjoyment of oral sex. The 1958 English case of Yvonne Jennion, who was found guilty of murdering her aunt, revolved around discussion of her sexuality and whether as a \u2018female homosexual\u2019 she could be regarded as a psychopathic personality (Seal, 2010). The recurrence of sexual deviance as an explanation for violence by women means that it can be understood as a \u2018stock story\u2019 that perpetuates restrictive views of acceptable female sexuality.\nAlthough doubts surround the safety of Amanda Knox's conviction, the use of stereotypical narratives of femininity in the media and criminal justice system is not troubling solely because it may contribute to a wrongful conviction. In the case of Yvonne Jennion it was the defence that sought to prove she was a psychopathic personality in order to win a verdict of manslaughter instead of murder (it did not succeed). The stories told during and about cases of murder communicate the values and assumptions of the era in which they take place \u2013 in the 1950s, \u2018homosexuality\u2019 was considered abnormal. The language used in the cases of Amanda Knox, Martha Beck, and Yvonne Jennion provides us with information about norms of femininity \u2013 what is perceived as the correct and appropriate behaviour for women.\nWhat counts as acceptable or deviant does, of course, change according to place and time. It would be unlikely that a woman's enjoyment of oral sex would be offered as an example of her \u2018perversity\u2019 in a murder trial in the present-day United States. Disagreement over the language employed to describe the gender of women accused of murder also highlights the shifting boundaries of appropriateness. The portrayal of Amanda Knox as sexually \u2018promiscuous\u2019 has been contested, with many arguing that her supposedly \u2018wild\u2019 lifestyle was neither shocking nor unusual, but normal behaviour for a 20 year old university student. Stories of women accused of murder are a cultural barometer of assumptions and arguments about the meanings of gender.\nSocial harm and the politics of capitalist crisis\nby Simon Pemberton\nLanguage is fundamental to how we reach an understanding of the harms we face in our daily lives. Indeed powerful ideologies, such as crime, exist to tell us exactly what and whom we should fear, with these discourses focused disproportionately on the least powerful groups in our society. Such discourses serve to draw our attention from the very serious harms produced by the state and corporate organisations and the damaging behaviours of the powerful. Yet, as the current recession highlights, the very organisation of our society in accordance with specific vested interests, can also produce serious and widespread harms, such as poverty, unemployment, and homelessness. The language of responsibility constructed in relation to structural harms is crucial to our understanding of their causes and how we should best respond to them. Such discussions, in the wake of the credit crunch have been inevitably highly politicised, as they necessarily entail subjecting the very organisation of our societies to scrutiny. The terms of this debate have shifted dramatically. Thus, whilst critiques surfaced following the credit crunch in relation to \u2018casino capitalism\u2019 these soon passed and were replaced by calls to reform a \u2018bloated and costly\u2019 public sector. Ironically, what began as a critique of neo-liberal forms of capitalist organisation, have been turned full circle to re-affirm the central tenets of this ideology providing the basis on which the social state may be dismantled \u2013 the very structures that could serve to ameliorate the impact of the harms detailed above.\nUnderpinning the prevailing neo-liberal language of responsibility is a set of assumptions about intentionality drawn from the liberal philosopher, Friedrich Hayek. For Hayek, market outcomes could not be considered unjust as the harms that result from them are unintended; for example, poor business decisions that result in unemployment. Furthermore, Hayek argued, as no consensus could ever be reached over the reallocation of social resources to ameliorate the consequences of harmful market consequences, there remains no just basis for a state to interfere in such outcomes. Whilst, Hayek's logic has not been followed to its ultimate conclusion in this instance, it clearly influences the current \u2018common sense\u2019 position toward the role of the state. An important critique of these ideas can be found in the work of Raymond Plant, which asserts that structural harms should be considered to be unjust, exactly because they are foreseeable and, therefore, preventable. To illustrate this point, in anticipation of the public sector cuts to be announced in the Comprehensive Spending Review, a number of analyses have demonstrated the harms that will result, alongside those communities that will bear the brunt of these cuts (see, for example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies Briefing Note BN108 and the TUC report Where the Money Goes). Given the awareness of these analyses, these potential structural harms are entirely foreseeable and, indeed, avoidable. They are avoidable exactly because alternative policy options are available to the coalition. Rather, it would appear that these harms are considered the \u2018price worth paying\u2019 to satisfy the demands of the international credit rating agencies. However, we should remind ourselves that other nations are running larger public debts than our own and have not felt the need to acquiesce to such demands. Alternative policy options exist, however, the construction of the current crisis serves to promote the interests of the financial markets at the expense of the vulnerable.\n\u2026powerful ideologies, such as crime, exist to tell us exactly what and whom we should fear, with these discourses focused disproportionately on the least powerful groups in our society.\nCrime does not exist\nby Nils Christie\nWords can create bridges between people: beautiful and useful bridges that bring ideas, emotions, and understanding back and forth. But words can also function as barriers.\nSome words are so big that they contain everything, and therefore nothing. We do not understand more when such concepts are used; we understand less and give thereby free room for manoeuvre to all sorts of political or professional authorities.\n\u2018Crime\u2019 is one of these words. We do not understand more by using this concept, we understand less. If we want to create a type of society where citizens participate, we need to describe deplorable acts in minute detail and with small words from the daily vocabulary.\nActs do not simply exist, they become. For all acts, including those seen by most people as unwanted, there are dozens of possible alternative ways of understanding them \u2013 bad, mad, evil, misplaced honour, youth bravado, political heroism \u2013 or crime. The \u2018same\u2019 acts can thus be met within several parallel systems as judicial, psychiatric, pedagogical, theological \u2013 or simply by understandings valid among family and friends.\nSocial and/or physical distance is of particular importance in how we attach meaning to particular acts. Persons close to me are mostly not seen as criminals. I see them too well; understand the reasons for their acts. But family life is only one of several examples of social conditions of a sort that creates resistance against perceiving acts as crimes and persons as criminals.\nTo refrain from the use of big abstract terms is more important in our time than ever before. We have created types of social life where we know each other less and less as whole human beings. Where we earlier could evaluate and react towards unwanted acts, we must now in our ignorance call in state power in the form of police. Back in the 1950s, some 30,000 cases were officially handled as \u2018crimes\u2019 in Norway. Now it is close to 300,000. This does not necessarily mean that the amount of unwanted acts have increased in this period. But it means that we now live under social conditions where most of us have lost close contact with the acts and actors, and thereby also lose the possibility to create our own interpretations of what happens. In such a situation it is particularly important to be presented with simple concrete terms in the description of the occurrences. We need detailed storytelling, not references to empty categories as \u2018crime\u2019.\n\u2018Crime\u2019 and \u2018criminals\u2019 are strong terms with large abilities to stick to persons. They etch other understandings of the acts and the humans behind the labels. They hide other understandings for interpretation of the acts and the humans behind the label. I have never met people \u2013 when I come close to them \u2013 who are only criminals. They are, as most of us, a mixture of good and bad. Some, maybe all, are walking mysteries. But some might have committed and are serving sentences for something terrible, and then all other aspects are overshadowed by the concept of that act or for the personality type he or she is found to be.\nDestructive words will often blossom among the many professionals so central in defining how humans are to be understood and governed: The psychopath, the paedophile, the manicdepressive \u2026\nDestructive words will often blossom among the many professionals so central in defining how humans are to be understood and governed: The psychopath, the paedophile, the manic-depressive, the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-child; the diagnostic manuals are filled to the brim. My alternative would be to tell the whole story.\nAnd how would I like to have the supposed behavioural expert to describe those they work with?\nAs whole persons, described in old-fashioned, pre-professional terms. Described so thoroughly that they became unsuitable for categorisation. I want to know something, concretely, on what occurred, and about the persons. Small words put together in small stories are particularly well suited to give us such knowledge. The big words from the toolbox of various professionals will often close both for insight in what happened and for informed social participation.\nBut without their language, experts would lose both authority and efficiency!\n1.

Such discourses serve to draw our attention from the very serious harms produced by the state and corporate organisations and the damaging behaviours of the powerful. Yet, as the current recession highlights, the very organisation of our society in accordance with specific vested interests, can also produce serious and widespread harms, such as poverty, unemployment, and homelessness. The language of responsibility constructed in relation to structural harms is crucial to our understanding of their causes and how we should best respond to them. Such discussions, in the wake of the credit crunch have been inevitably highly politicised, as they necessarily entail subjecting the very organisation of our societies to scrutiny. The terms of this debate have shifted dramatically. Thus, whilst critiques surfaced following the credit crunch in relation to \u2018casino capitalism\u2019 these soon passed and were replaced by calls to reform a \u2018bloated and costly\u2019 public sector.

Furthermore, Hayek argued, as no consensus could ever be reached over the reallocation of social resources to ameliorate the consequences of harmful market consequences, there remains no just basis for a state to interfere in such outcomes. Whilst, Hayek's logic has not been followed to its ultimate conclusion in this instance, it clearly influences the current \u2018common sense\u2019 position toward the role of the state. An important critique of these ideas can be found in the work of Raymond Plant, which asserts that structural harms should be considered to be unjust, exactly because they are foreseeable and, therefore, preventable. To illustrate this point, in anticipation of the public sector cuts to be announced in the Comprehensive Spending Review, a number of analyses have demonstrated the harms that will result, alongside those communities that will bear the brunt of these cuts (see, for example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies Briefing Note BN108 and the TUC report Where the Money Goes).

{"doc": {"text": "Everyone always has the idea of having their dream football manager save with a team that are down at the bottom of the footballing ladder, this guide will (hopefully) help you convert your team into a force to be reckoned with. As well as changing their professional status. Managing semi-pro clubs in FM19? Read on!\nThis changing your professional status guide will focus on these three components:\n- Progression & Commitment\nThis article was inspired by my success with a semi-professional team in the Welsh Premier League, who are known as Connah\u2019s Quay Nomads. I took over Connah\u2019s Quay Nomads as I was tired of TNS winning it absolutely every year in real life. Wanting to create a save in which I would challenge myself. In the save, I am currently in (July 2025) and have had a large amount of success with this save. Coming to the conclusion my development through the save has came down to three key components. I\u2019m going to write about how I turned this team in to a dominant force on and off the pitch at all levels.\nThis guide can be applied to any team, you just have to think logically and apply it to your own save. The only way your professional status won\u2019t change is if it\u2019s hard-coded.\nMoney is so important. TRUST ME. \u2013 Managing semi-pro clubs in FM19\nEveryone wants it, but not everyone gets it on Football Manager. This was by far the most important aspect as how I have converted this team in to a team that fights in Europe. One of the most important factors in making money is selecting a team in which it is achievable in a short period of time.\nFor example picking a team in the Vanamara North League is less likely to boost your income then picking a team in the Welsh Premier League. The reason for this is Europe. This is by far the biggest income you could ever ask for. So ensure you pick a team that you would be able to get some sort of continental championship that you can compete for. Unless, you want a long winded save. The money you get from Europe is one of the easiest ways to turn your amateur or semi-pro team into a professional team.\nContracts are another way in which you can have a big say in the money you are spending. I will talk about players later on, but for now this is focusing on contracts. It is hard not to give your best player the best possible contract. But it will affect how much you earn. That extra \u00a3300 a week can really add up if you\u2019re a smaller club, put it this way 300 multiplied by 52 is equal to \u00a315,600. If you\u2019re a big club this is nothing, if you happen to be a small club this is a lot. This all adds up, think about if five of your players want an extra \u00a3300 a week that reaches a total of \u00a378,000.\nKing Kenny?- Managing semi-pro clubs in FM19\nNow that is serious money and something you should really pay close attention to. I never really paid attention to finances as much as I have with this save. It\u2019s really benefited me for future saves. I always remember this famous quote by Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish \u2013\nKenny is right, if a player doesn\u2019t want to play on the wages you want to pay, look elsewhere. Maybe the next player you find isn\u2019t as good, but just think of the wages that you are saving and the progression you are making in finances. One of the biggest burdens on a players contract for me is their playing fee and unused substitution fee. I always exclude these from contracts. You may think your player is on a basic \u00a31000 a week contract until you look closely and realise he will receive an extra \u00a3300 for playing. As well as \u00a3200 for being an unused substitute.\nYou must, and I can\u2019t stress this enough try to get the best deal that benefits you, the club is your best interests. This can all depend on your professional status as well.\nFinances that benefit, for changing professional status- Managing semi-pro clubs in FM19\nDon\u2019t worry about cash flow if you are in any continental championship. Below is a graphic of my save and the finances \u2013\nThis might look like it spikes in areas, which it does. But this isn\u2019t down to poor cash flow it is solely relying on Europe for the main source of income. In my first season it slowly declines over the season. I was really worried I would liquidate the club if I didn\u2019t have any other income. That season I qualified for European qualification rounds, I didn\u2019t do well.\nHowever, I still got a lot of money for it and that money has kept coming in consecutive seasons. This has meant that the better I do in Europe the more money I will receive. This massively helps the board decide whether they want to change your professional status.\nIgnore Cashflow- Managing semi-pro clubs in FM19\nIf you look at the image from the 2021 season it looks like I was making pennies in comparison to this. This particular season I qualified for the Champions League group stage because of how fortunate the draws were in the qualifying stages. I didn\u2019t do well in the group stages but I still received this amount of money \u2013\nI don\u2019t think I will get in to the group stages again in the following year but that \u00a311.32 Million has completely revamped the actual club and I don\u2019t mean in terms of personnel.\nThe money has allowed me to continue to develop and grow the club off field. In terms of facilities and scouting range, this is something that is massively under rated and often overlooked for smaller clubs.\nI want to look at my finances in a bit more depth and I have broken the finances into years \u2013\nConclusion- Managing semi-pro clubs in FM19\nI have added a black line in each season as to when it typically starts, so for my case this is August. Also adding a year to each segment, so you can see the progression as well as the maximum amount of money I had at any given time in this time frame. The money benefits really help changing the professional status.\nIt is all about patience, you won\u2019t become an overnight billionaire and it wasn\u2019t until the 2020/21 season where I really pushed myself to strive for professional status. I finished third in this season, which was one better than the season before. But I won in the qualification for Europe which meant I could try and earn money for winning in at least one qualifying round.\nI got to the third qualifying round for the Europa League but that was more than enough. It meant that I received \u00a389k per round and took home an extra \u00a3209k which meant just from three qualifying rounds of the Europa league the club would earn approximately \u00a3476k. This was the start of the money coming in to the club, because of this money I could sign a couple of players for cash and pay that little bit extra and with better players it meant I could challenge more.\nThat is exactly what I did in the following season where I somehow beat Rangers in the fourth qualifying round in the Europa and placed myself in a group, obviously the team got beat every game but I just wanted the money. This meant with this new money, I had a balance of \u00a32.8 Million \u2013 this was the first time the board wanted to go professional and because I had more than \u00a31 Million in the bank it went ahead.\nFirst Season when professional status change- Managing semi-pro clubs in FM19\nMy first season as a professional club I finally took the title of TNS and signed some wonderful talents along the way. The first season as a professional club was fantastic. However, the board upgraded my youth and training facilities which meant I was a bit short for cash in some months. That all changed when I qualified for the Champions league qualifiers. Unfortunately losing out to Shaktar in the deciding round but meant I could have a spot in the Europa League.\nEurope has really allowed me to blossom and take advantage of the money that you gain from it. In my last season, one round in the Champions League covered the full costings of my wages for an ENTIRE YEAR. That is the kind of money I wanted and will continue to get as I develop the club, but don\u2019t forget to develop the club in different ways.\nPlayers to sign when wanting to change professional status- Managing semi-pro clubs in FM19\nEveryone loves a good new-gen and these lower reputation clubs will relish from another clubs loss. Players get you results with the right management and that\u2019s the mindset I have had throughout this save. I have taken a lot of risks and chances on players who might not look fantastic but play with a consistent rating. In particular I started looking at a mix of youth and experience, but experience definitely won the battle at the time.\nAs the club was semi-professional at the time I could only sign players who had played in Wales before or were Welsh and this was a struggle. But I found some fantastic players along the way. TNS were the only professional club at the time so every time they let go of players I was first on the door offering them contracts. I spent a total of \u00a32.2k in my first year and signed a massive 20 players. That seems a lot but the contracts were so small I wanted to give everyone an opportunity and offered them a year contract or if it was in January a six month contract and then reassess them at the end of the season.\nI have always had a high turn over of players in my first few years whilst managing a club, and this didn\u2019t change. This is why it is so important to try and change your professional status. It helps with transfers.\nPlayers to look for- Managing semi-pro clubs in FM19\nI particularly looked for players who suited my formation. Playing a simple 4-4-2 and relied on pacey strikers who could beat the last man. I signed about six strikers to fill two roles and looked for players who were fast. Searching specifically for the pace and acceleration before I even considered their finishing or composure and this worked. The league isn\u2019t that great and the defenders struggled to keep up, and it was a case of I want to score as many goals as possible before the opposition exploit my weaknesses.\nAge really didn\u2019t matter. I am a semi-professional team looking to change my professional status and the fortunes of the club and I knew that players would only be there for a year and move on or retire.\nUse a lot of players or have a larger squad. This was something I did, I always had cover, if my best striker was injured I knew I had someone on the bench who could do the job. I have the most players used in every season so far, and this will never change. Trying to focus on every competition and give it my all. After all, the prize money is something that was appetising and it also meant I could increase the clubs reputation and attract better players. I always look at the bigger picture and how one trophy can affect the club in the long run.\nDevelopment- Managing semi-pro clubs in FM19\nIf they are good enough play them. I always see people have fantastic new-gens and they just let them play in the reserves, I had a couple of new-gens and played them. One is now my best player and captain and is a big part of why I have so many trophies, take a look at him \u2013\nI mean if you just compare the two and look at how much he has grown in five years, it is quite remarkable. He has went from an outcast who got given an opportunity to the clubs captain. He is also my most paid player, I have a team in the Champions League who I pay \u00a31,400 a week to.\nRemember Kenny Dalglish\u2019s quote? I stuck by this and never over paid him \u2013 I still pay less wages than TNS and I have just completed the quadruple(League, MG cup, IRN BRU cup and Welsh cup).\nTips and tricks- Managing semi-pro clubs in FM19\nAs time goes by, look at your youth and really take time out to see what you can do to make them better. What I did was create a team where there was at least two players in every position on the pitch and left them to it, granted some were good and others weren\u2019t but it gave the club stability and I worked on this a lot.\nI believe that if you\u2019re winning games you are typically happy. If you\u2019re happy you want to play. If you want to play you are going to learn and that\u2019s exactly why I focus on my youth recruitment. Having the most successful youth team who have just completed their season winning the league unbeaten and drawing two out of a possible 22.\nKeep it simple. I see no point in trying to replicate how Barcelona play with their Tiki-Taka, keep it simple. My system started out with a direct passing system which I try to exploit the flanks and then play early crosses for my fast strikers to latch on to. I won\u2019t discuss tactics in depth in this article as there are more important factors in changing your professional status.\nProgression & Commitment / Professional Status- Managing semi-pro clubs in FM19\nA little step backwards to go a big step forward is good. At any club you want to progress through the ranks, and this is no different. Even if one season you don\u2019t do as well as expected you can always leap back the next season. There are far too many people who will play the game and then give up after four years because they haven\u2019t won the Champions League with a Sunday league standard team.\nIf you are wanting to challenge yourself with a lesser team, make sure you are committed, a lot of people give up at the first hurdle. I didn\u2019t and I have had the most fun I have ever had on Football Manager, I have a team in the Welsh Premier League who lost one game in all competitions apart from the Champions League and a Reserve team that has just won the title unbeaten.\nThe aim of using a lesser team is to progress, but that doesn\u2019t always have to be on the pitch. You may have a bad season but your finances are good or you have a player who will break in to the first team who will really change your fortunes. There are always positives to take from any situation when being a lesser team, and that\u2019s something I have learnt throughout this save.\nProgression- Managing semi-pro clubs in FM19\nI lost one of my best players to Atlanta United and only got around \u00a310k. But it freed up a position and the replacement I got didn\u2019t look at all good, but he ended up being the leagues top goal scorer in the season we finished third.\nWhen talking about progression, always keep an eye out on some of the other teams players, there are some incredible players who don\u2019t look as good as they play. I often look at the leagues best average ratings and look at players in which you can use as your own. If things don\u2019t work out with the particular player at least another team aren\u2019t benefiting from his tremendous performances.\nSpend time on the finer things. This is something I can\u2019t stress enough, look at your team, analyse what\u2019s been going right, look at what\u2019s been going wrong and create a solution to prevent the wrong things from happening again. It\u2019s important, there are so many details that people ignore and then wonder why they are struggling. If your team is conceding the majority of goals from through balls look at what your defenders might be lacking in, if it\u2019s pace get them to drop deeper. Or if it\u2019s their off the ball intelligence, look at players who bring more to the table. Always look to improve the team, there are some gems you can find in Amateur teams that will really help you. Don\u2019t just think because they play for an amateur team they are rubbish.\nProgress off field and facilities that help towards the change in professional status- Managing semi-pro clubs in FM19\nProgress off the field is something that needs to be done. Sign better staff, I always look to improve my staff every year and because I play on FM Touch it means each contract is a year rolling contract so they can be released upon their contract ending. I always look to improve each member of staff \u2013 what\u2019s the point in making your team better if the coaches aren\u2019t. Other things to focus on progressing is definitely your training and youth facilities, mine are the best in the league now, but I\u2019d focus on making yourself professional first as players on professional contracts train more than a semi-professional.\nThe youth facilities are also important, you want your youth teams to improve year upon year and giving them a platform where they can develop is essential. Finally, scouting, make sure you try and increase your scouting range, you will seriously find some incredible players from overseas if you do this. Obviously this is all money dependant but because this subject is about progression, you should actively look how you can improve the team in more ways than one.\nThe End of changing your professional status- Managing semi-pro clubs in FM19\nUltimately the idea of the game is to have fun, enjoy yourself, take risks and look for hidden gems where you can. The hidden gems can really shape your future. I hope this guide will either help you. It may even give you inspiration for a future save you may have in mind. I have thoroughly enjoyed writing this and struggled to fit in everything that I could think of. These little elements can create a team that really fight for their trophies and progress as each year comes by.

One of the biggest burdens on a players contract for me is their playing fee and unused substitution fee. I always exclude these from contracts. You may think your player is on a basic \u00a31000 a week contract until you look closely and realise he will receive an extra \u00a3300 for playing.

{"doc": {"text": "\u201cVaginal seeding\u201d is growing in popularity because it\u2019s thought that babies born through Cesarean-section miss out on certain \u201chelpful\u201d vaginal microbes that might shield the infant from asthma, allergies and immune disorders.\n\u201cVaginal seeding has become a rising trend for patients,\u201d noted Dr. Jennifer Wu, an ob/gyn at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \u201cPatients read about the benefits of a vaginal delivery and hope to replicate these benefits with vaginal seeding.\u201d\nAs explained by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), it\u2019s thought that contact with healthy vaginal bacteria helps stimulate the infant immune system, prevents the growth of dangerous bacteria and regulates the gut. That contact doesn\u2019t happen for babies born via C-section, however, so in vaginal seeding, a cotton swab with vaginal fluids from the mother is used to transfer vaginal bacteria to a newborn.\nBut in a statement issued Oct. 24, ACOG \u2013 the nation\u2019s largest ob/gyn organization \u2013 said the procedure is not recommended because the known risks outweigh any potential benefits. \u201cDue to the lack of sufficient data, the very real risks [of vaginal seeding] outweigh the potential benefits,\u201d Dr. Christopher Zahn, ACOG\u2019s vice president of practice activities, said in a college news release. \u201cBy swabbing an infant\u2019s mouth, nose or skin with vaginal fluid after birth, the mother could potentially, and unknowingly, pass on disease-causing bacteria or viruses,\u201d he explained.\nWu agreed. \u201cThere are very real risks attached to this practice,\u201d she said. \u201cCertain viruses, such as group B step and herpes, can cause serious illnesses such as meningitis in newborns.\u201d\nAnd Zahn stressed that there\u2019s a much safer way for a new mom to transfer her helpful bacteria to her newborn: Breast-feeding. \u201cBreast-feeding for the first six months is the best way to overcome the lack of exposure to maternal vaginal flora at birth,\u201d Zahn said. \u201cThe bacteria present in breast mild and on the nipple is sufficient for natural colonization or seeding of the gut. There may be some initial difference in the gut [microbes] of infants based on mode of delivery, but research has shown that difference disappears after about six months,\u201d he added.\nIt seems to me that the ACOG is overlooking the obvious \u2013 if you avoid the C-section, vaginal delivery makes this argument mute.\nThe rate of C-section in the United States in 2013 was 32.7%, roughly a third of all deliveries. The World Health Organization (WHO) states the \u201cmedical necessary\u201d C-sections account for no more than 10% of all deliveries.\nPhysicians like C-sections because they are scheduled rather than spontaneous and generate significantly more income. On average, the cost of a C-section is 50% higher than a natural birth.\nI also question the concerns raised about possible infection. Studies on women with known herpes infections failed to find one case of transmission to the newborn, although herpes antibodies were frequently found in both cord and neonatal blood samples. It appears that the mother\u2019s immune system protects the child from most vaginal infections.\nIt\u2019s not just \u201cthought that contact with healthy vaginal bacteria helps stimulate the infant immune system, prevents the growth of dangerous bacteria and regulates the gut.\u201d There are many evidence based studies that prove that inoculation of healthy bacteria during vaginal delivery improves many aspects of health, including long term morbidity and mortality.\nThe Bottom Line:\nThe take away from this study is reduce the rate of C-section from a third of all births to 10% where it belongs.

How bad is a cruise's carbon footprint?\n- Emmy Silverthorne\nI wish I had better news but cruises are on the heavy side of the carbon emissions scale. Don't get me wrong, we all deserve vacations to exotic places during our mountain winters. When choosing your vehicle of transportation to paradise, consider your carbon footprint.\nNina Rastogi, from The Green Lantern, determined carbon emissions for a seven-day Carnival cruise from Miami, via the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Belize and Mexico, to Florida (a whopping 1,826.5 miles) is equivalent to a personal emission of 2,137 pounds of CO2 (roughly a ton). A round-trip flight on a jet from Miami to Grand Cayman would emit around 340 pounds of CO2. Big difference!\nRastogi points out that a cruise ship provides more than a seat on an airplane - there's also accommodation and entertainment (which leads to a host of additional waste and environmental impacts). Not to mention the flight or drive to the destination of the cruise. That's two strikes on your carbon footprint. Ouch!\nIn between ports, cruise ships serve as a floating hotel and party boat. All that partying and all-you-can-eat buffets leads to more waste. Friends of the Earth found that a 3,000-passenger cruise ship (the average) produced about 210,000 gallons of human sewage, eight tons of garbage and more than 130 gallons of toxic waste on a one-week voyage. I know we like to let loose on vacation but can't we be responsible travelers at the same time?\nIf you remember, only a year ago, the Costa Concordia was grounded off the island of Giglio, along the Tuscan coast. With 2,380 tons of onboard fuel reserves, the damages to the environment and the popular tourist destination could have been catastrophic. As a silver lining, the incident did bring international focus on the operations of cruise lines everywhere. Especially, their impact on our planet.\nInternationally, big-ship vacations have increased in popularity with nearly 20 million passengers cruising in 2012. Even though cruises allow people to see a variety of destinations all on one trip, Responsible Vacations found cruises bring limited economic benefit to local communities and small businesses.\nThe Daily Green reported that a cruise ship generates more air pollution than 12,000 cars in a single day. A frightening statistic when you consider that prior to 2012's new international fuel standards, most cruise lines burned a cheap grade, \"dirty\" fuel. Critics argue that most cruise lines get away with doing the bare minimum, squeezing through loopholes.\nThere are cruise lines that have made some environmental strides like the Cunard Line, which has improved the coating on the hull to reduce air emissions. Holland America purchases electricity when stationed at port, as opposed to burning more fuel. The Norwegian Cruise Line offloads used cooking oil in Hawaii for recycling into bio-diesel. At the Port of Miami, the line has donated approximately 1,300 gallons of cooking oil to an organic farmer. The farmer has converted the oil into 870 gallons of bio-diesel to power farming equipment. Celebrity Cruises has installed solar panels to power the ship's elevators and LED lights, saving up to 50 percent on energy demands.\nThen there's the whale-size impact of wastewater from the ginormous ships. There are three basic types of wastewater on cruise ships. Bilge water is oily, engine run-off and condensation that collects in the bilge of the ship and is eventually pumped out. Grey water comes from onboard showers and sinks. Last is the dreaded black water, which comes from the toilets and drains of the infirmary.\nIn addition to sewage, it is estimated that an average cruise ship generates 1 million gallons of gray water and 25,000 gallons of oily bilge water. Most, if not all, cruise lines now employ onboard wastewater purifying systems. However, they must use mechanical, chemical and biological measures to allow the \"clean\" byproduct to be discharged at sea.\nIf you do choose a cruise, remember it is not solely the company's responsibility to ensure sustainability. Each of us, whether at home or on vacation, has to do our part to decrease our carbon footprint.\nOnboard, be sure to turn off the lights when not in your cabin; don't let your eyes become bigger than your belly while grazing through the massive buffets; and take public transit or walk when at port. Also, the elevators and mechanical doors should be for folks with limited mobility. In addition to saving energy and fuel, using your legs is a great way to avoid the 10-pound souvenir around your waistline.

Zatural only gives you the CBD milligram (mg) so you know the true strength of CBD in each bottle.\n2. Product of the USA\nMost CBD oil companies will not list the country source of their products for 2 reasons: 1. They don\u2019t know the source or 2. The CBD from a country such as China where the quality is inferior and grown with chemicals or exposed to chemicals in the processing.\nWHY ZATURAL? All of our CBD products are are sustainably grown and sourced from premium hemp family farms right here in the USA. This plant is from the Cannabis family but is NOT marijuana. The 2018 USA farm bill made it legal for Industrial hemp to be grown in all 50 states.\n3. No Fillers, No Additives, No Artificial Colors or Flavors\nRead the labels! Other companies use 'other ingredients' including but not limited to:\n- Ascorbyl Palmitate\n- Alpha Tocopherol\n- Monk Fruit\n- Olive Oil\n- MCT Oil\nWHY ZATURAL? Zatural\u2122 not only cuts out the middleman to save you tons of money, but you won't find a more pure and fresh CBD Oil on the market. Zatural\u2122 CBD Oil contains 100% Cannabis Sativa. (if you get the peppermint flavor, pure peppermint essential oil and stevia, a natural sweetener are added).\n4. Full Spectrum THC Free CBD Oil vs Isolate CBD Oil\nFull-spectrum CBD comes from the Cannabis Sativa plant and contains the whole plant full of cannabinoids, including THC. Unless the company specifically states the product is THC Free, you should assume it contains THC(which is the same psychoactive ingredient found in marijuana).\nWhen the CBD Oil contains even trace amounts of THC, you run the risk of testing positive on a drug test. The safest way to ensure a negative drug test and the side effects of THC is to completely avoid it.\nCBD Isolate has been isolated from the plant compounds. Using a process called chromatography, the plant materials are removed. The result is a white powder. The other cannabinoids and plant terpenes are removed. CBD isolate is flavorless and odorless but doesn\u2019t offer all the plant benefits of the full spectrum CBD Oil.\nCannabidiol (CBD) is just one of many exogenous cannabinoids found in the cannabis plants. In fact, there are 113 other cannabinoids found in hemp extract. When you select a full spectrum THC Free CBD product, you benefit from this multitude of potentially beneficial exogenous cannabinoids, as well as the plant terpenes and flavonoids found in the original hemp plant. With a full-spectrum product, these compounds are left available in the same ratios that nature intended. The additional compounds found in a full spectrum THC free CBD products include:\n- All 20 essential amino acids\n- Calcium and magnesium\n- Phosphorus and zinc\n- Omega-3 fatty acids\n- Vitamins C, E and A\n- B complex vitamins\n- Iron and potassium\nMany CBD enthusiasts believe that full-spectrum CBD products are the most beneficial to your endocannabinoid system and to your overall health. These compounds are all synergistic, meaning each compound interacts with the others to enhance each component, creating an entourage effect.\nWHY ZATURAL? We, at Zatural\u2122 believe the more natural the better. That is why full spectrum is our choice for Zatural\u2122 CBD Oil.\n6. Zatural\u2122 CBD Oil available in many strengths and sizes.\nFor just about every need and budget, you can find the strength, size and flavor you are looking for. Plus Zatural offers dog, cat and horse formulas with exact serving sizes to help take out the guess work on adequate dosages for your pets.\n7.

CRUMRINE LENS MOUNZ Filed July 25, 1939 CHESTER MCQUMP/NE ATIORNE Y Patented June 10, 1941 LENS MOUNT Chester W. Crumrine, Rochester, N. Y., assignor to Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, N. Y., a corporation of New Jersey Application July 25, 1939, Serial No. 286,385\nThis invention relates to optical systems and particularly to lens mounts.\nIt is an object of the invention to provide a method of mounting lenses and particularly single lenses or elements, alone or as part of a more complex system.\nIt is a particular object of the invention to provide an extremely inexpensive but highly accurate lens mount which can be safely assembled by simply inserting the mount into a tube provided therefor. The tube may be cylindrical (or conical) with circular, rectangular or any desired cross section.\nBy way of example, the simple cylindrical case which cylinder has a circular cross section, will be considered in detail. If a lens element such as a meniscus glass element is fitted snugly into a mount there is pressure exerted on the element from all sides toward the optic axis thereof. Such pressure is liable to cause occasional break-,\nage of the lenses during manufacture and to introduce strain into the lens which, from an optical viewpoint, is, of course, quite unsatisfactory and which also makes the lenses susceptible to breakage during later use.\nAccording to the present invention, this pressure on the lens is descreased and the troubles caused thereby eliminated by molding a plastic rim onto the periphery of the lens which rim extends axially from both sides of the lens and has an outer surface which is substantially concave toric. In this connection, the word toric is used to include any surface in which the diameter near the center is less than the diameter near the end of the cylinder. of course, in the case of a cone the actual diameter of the rim adjacent to the lens may be slightly greater than the diameter at one end of the rim, but since the chamber into which the lens is to be mounted in a camera would also be conical in this case, the efiective diameter of the rim near the lens is less than the efiective diameter of the rim at either end.\nWhen this arrangement of the rim is used, the rim may be inserted fitting snugly into a cylinder and the pressure of the cylinder on the rim will be exerted mainly on the ends of the rim and not on that portion adjacent to the lens. The lens itself will exert a counterpressure outward on the central part of the rim and the rim will be distorted slightly under these pressures. That is, the rim itself will change in shape so that no excessive pressures will be exerted on the lens element itself.\nThe present invention-is particularly useful with those described in copending applications, Serial Numbers 286,386 and 286,384 filed concurrently herewith by Donald L. Wood and by myself respectively.\nOther objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description when read in connection with the accompanying drawing in which- Fig. 1 shows a simple meniscus lens in cross section.\nFig. 2 shows the cross section of the pertinent parts of a molding machine for mounting a lens according to the invention.\nFig. 3 shows one embodiment of the invention.\nFig. 4 shows the embodiment shown in Fig. 3 as mounted in a portion of a camera wall.\nIn Fig. 1 a meniscus lens element Hl having an optic axis H is shown in cross section. The\nsurfaces of this lens have radii of curvature RI 20 and R2 respectively and the axial thickness thereof is T. Since the element as shown is in that stage of manufacture in which it has not yet been centered, the diameter thereof taken from the optic axis is different in difierent directions as indicated by HI and H2.\nIn Fig. 2 the lens element I0 is held by a zonal clamp consisting of members I4 and IS in a molding machine comprising molds l6 and IT. The zonal clamp members l4 and I5 are carried by plungers l2 and I3 respectively, the\nplunger 12 being held in place by a spring I9- and a plate 20 and the plunger 13 being held in place by a screw 2| in a plate 22 having an adjusting knob 23 with scale 24 and index 25.\nAccording to the invention a rim is molded onto the element In by injecting a plastic through an injection nozzle 21 into the chamber 26 around the periphery of the lens. The zonal clamp members l4 and I5 prevent any-of the plastic entering chamber 28 adjacent to the central portions of the lens surfaces. According to the invention, the molding machine is so ar ranged that the outer surface of the rim is slightly concave. This is best seen in Fig. 3 wherein the rim of the lens 10 is indicated as 30. The outer surface 29 of this rim is seen to be concave toric. Incidentally, since the lens [0 is held by a zonal clamp in the mold, the outer periphery of this rim 3'0 is optically centered on the axis H as indicated by the arrows H.\nFurthermore, I have made the surprising discovery, that a rim molded as shown in the drawing, which rim has an axial length greater than its radial thickness and which rim extends axially from both sides of the lens, will have the required concave surface 29 .if it is made by injecting the molding into a mold whose walls are straight and cylindrical. That is, although the mold itself has straight walls the rim when finished and removed from the mold will assume a shape in which the outer surface is concave toric.\nAs shown in Fig. 4, this lens ill in its rim 30 may be inserted snugly into a chamber, for example, in the wall of a camera. The rim 3B is pushed into this chamber until the end surface of the rim comes in contact with an abutment 33 in such a camera wall 32, which is also provided with an aperture 35 which acts as the aperture for the lens I 0.\nThe Fig. 4 illustrates the advantage of this type of rim. As is shown, the rim 30 fits snugly into a cylinder in the housing 32 so that pressure indicated by arrows 36 is exerted on the ends of this rim 30. The fit is snuggest at the ends of the rim. Due to the curvature of the surface 29, there is no direct pressure on the rim 30 adjacent to the lens element I0. On the other hand, the\nelement Ill exerts a counterpressure 31 outward on the rim 30 and together with the pressure exerted at the point 36, this pressure distorts the rim 3!] bending it to or towards a shape in which the Outer surface 29 thereof is perfectly cylindrical and not concave. Actually of course, the surface 29 remains slightly concave even when inserted in 'thech-am-ber' provided therefor. Although the curvature 29 is very slight and the amount of distortion of the rim 30 which is permissible is also very small, this invention succeeds in reducng the pressure on the lens l suf- I ficiently to eliminate breakage during manufacture and strain in the lens after it is mounted in a camera.\nObviously by having the injection nozzle and the line of separation of the mold shown in Fig. 2 at a point opposite to the lens l0 instead of at one end of the rim chamber 26, the mold could be arranged so that the concavity of the surface 29 could beany desired amount. However, I have found that sufficient concavity and in fact an almost ideal arrangement is produced when the surface of the mold H is perfectly flat, or more correctly is perfectly cylindrical.\nIf the radial thickness of the rim 30 is too great, compared with its axial thickness, 1. e., its length, the resiliency of the rim is reduced to a point where little advantage is gained by the invention. However, it is difilcult to state exactly when this advantage becomes negligible, but in general the radial thickness of the rim should not be greater than its length. and of course thelength should be sufllcient to extend axially from both sides of the rim of the lens Ill.\nHaving thus described in detail one embodiment of my invention, 1' wish to point out that it is not limited to the specific structure shown but is of the scope of the appended claims.\nWhat I claim and desire to secure by Letters Patent of the United States is:\n1. A camera lens mount comprising a camera wall having a tubular aperture therein, an abutment on the inner wall of the tubular aperture, a, plastic rim holding said lens in axial alignment in the aperture and fitting snugly in the tubular aperture against said abutment, the outer surface of the rim being concave toric whereby the fit is snuggest near the from and rear edges of the rim.\n2. An optical system comprising a tubular lens mount, abutment meanson the inner wall of the tubular mount, a lens axially aligned in the mount and a plastic rim for the lens fitting snugly in the mount and against the abutment means, the outer surface of the rim being concave in section and the fit between the rim and the mount being tightest at the front amid ear edges of the rim.\nCHESTER W.

{"doc": {"text": "As I said previously, in March (in New York Timeline (1913)), I\u2019m totally fascinated by Rudolph Valentino\u2019s first years in the USA; particularly those spent in and around New York from 1913 to 1917. Forty two or so months crammed with incident; six months of which are, apparently, an impenetrable void. This month, June, I look in some detail at 1914 \u2014 one of his most difficult years. Anyway, here is: New York Timeline (1914).\nFor Marchese Guglielmi the first few months of 1914 are, for-want-of-a-better-phrase, a Social Whirl. Determined to put behind him his miserable Festive Period, he plunges into the dance-mad city of New York. His accommodation, Giolito\u2019s, at 108-110 W. 49th St., is situated just east of Broadway, ten blocks south of Central Park, ten or so more north west, of the gleaming and glistening, newly-opened Grand Central Station, and a quick walk away from several exciting afternoon and evening establishments. At which, by all accounts, he becomes a regular.\nHe calls on his fellow S. S. Cleveland passenger, Miss Eleanor Post, and they go riding in Central Park at least once. He also pays a visit and introduces himself (with a letter of introduction), to Social Butterfly, Schuyler L. Parsons Jr.; who invites him to remain for dinner and then join the various guests, when they go out to dance until the early hours.\nMiss Post had, along with Marion Herrion, been the young woman who\u2019d enjoyed many hours dancing the latest dances, with Rodolfo Guglielmi, in the Second Class dining room. (Their friendship didn\u2019t last.) Mr. Parsons, meanwhile, was a person whose name appeared in the press with alarming regularity, as an attendee, of dinner and theatre parties, dance parties and other exclusive society events. It\u2019s interesting that he featured in an amateur film, The Flame of Kapur (1916), as a villain, not dissimilar to the sort played by Valentino a few years later. (He was to be a friend of Rudy\u2019s right to the end.)\nRodolfo continues to socialise hopeful it\u2019ll lead to something. He reacquaints himself with three Paris friends: brothers Count Otto and Count Alex. von Salm-Hoogstraeten, and their friend, Georges/George T. Aranyi. The trio are in the US to play tennis, and Rodolfo no doubt watches them, at the National Indoor Championship Tournament, at the Seventh Regiment Armoury, 643 Park Avenue, in mid. February. Afterwards, in the evenings, the quartet enjoy nights out.\nAustrians, Otto and Alex., and Frenchman George, too, were seemingly all a little older than their Italian playmate. (Otto was born in 1886 and Alex. (who would perish during WW1) in 1890.) So being in their company would\u2019ve been something of an education for someone not yet 19. I personally don\u2019t believe that the Salms taught Valentino to tango at the Central Park Zoo, as his female fellow passengers on the Cleveland said he already knew it. However, there\u2019s no doubt they taught him other things, and that he was a willing Pupil.\nThe addiction of New Yorkers at this time to dancing is clear when we peruse the city\u2019s newspapers and see how often it\u2019s mentioned. At the start of the month a report states that the Pope has neither banned the Tango nor endorsed La Furlana. A review, days later, of The Laughing Husband, an operetta at the Knickerbocker Theatre, reveals how \u201cGraceful Steps [Of] A New Sort\u201d had been added to the U. S. adaptation, and that the chorus did \u201cThe Tango\u201d. (You can listen to a medley here.) On the 9th, we see a story about 2,000 waiters, trotting, tangoing, dipping, maxixeing, and hesitating, at the Manhattan Waiters\u2019 Association Annual Ball. (In many instances with each other.) On the 14th, we view fourteen recent or expected social gatherings, of which seven included dancing. The 17th saw the Castles, Vernon and Irene, explaining to Marguerite Mooers Marshall, a columnist, how to dance the Half and Half. And at the close of February, we learn that the Arabian Nights Ball, on the 26th, at the Folies Marigny, had begun at midnight, and had been: \u201c\u2026 JUST ONE DANCE AFTER ANOTHER.\u201d\nThanks to high living and nightly shenanigans, with the Salms, Aranyi, and with others, Rodolfo\u2019s funds are dwindling; and as he commences the month, he begins to appreciate he\u2019s unable to continue in the same fashion as in January and February. In order to save money he quits his quarters at Giolito\u2019s, and moves to less expensive, unknown, Uptown rooms.\nKnowing he\u2019ll soon have to find employment, he\u2019s also eager to seriously improve his basic English. He understands that what he learned at Nervi won\u2019t be sufficient for him to be able to work, and he\u2019ll be unable to improve it, while he\u2019s surrounded by fellow Italians.\nHis departure from Giolito\u2019s isn\u2019t fixed in stone and it could easily have occurred in February. The reason being, that the position he secured as a Gardener (thanks to a letter of introduction (from his older brother Alberto), to outgoing Commissioner of Immigration, William Williams), commenced after the snow had melted. As I only saw bad snow reported locally in early March, and not later, we have to accept the possibility he was out of his initial accommodation earlier than was previously thought. Maybe even by the middle of February.\nAfter some work, which included planting rhododendrons (which are still there and are referred to as \u2018Rudy\u2019s Rhodos\u2019), his employment with Mr. Bliss, at his estate, at Brookville, outside the city on Long Island, abruptly ends, after he crashes a borrowed motorcycle. It\u2019s also an issue that the return of Mrs. Bliss, from Europe, has ended plans for an Italian garden. Rodolfo himself isn\u2019t enjoying being so far from Manhattan. And isn\u2019t too pleased to be eating his meals with the other servants.\nCornelius N. Bliss Jr., a kind-hearted type, then President of the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor, provides him with a letter of introduction, to the New York City Parks Commissioner, Louis F. La Roche. He also, amazingly, provides him with a small weekly allowance so that he can manage in the short term.\nRudy returns to Manhattan, able, just about, to manage on his recent earnings, and his allowance from Bliss. Despite his worsening situation, it seems, from time-to-time, that he\u2019s still able to enjoy the cafes and restaurants.\nRodolfo Guglielmi doesn\u2019t grasp that Mr. and Mrs. Bliss are two people who, in time, could\u2019ve seriously helped him with a career as a Landscape Gardener. However, he did understand he was a million miles from entering, or being accepted in, Society. Painfully aware. And this was something of a problem for him.\nAfter resettling back in the city, sometime in May, Rodolfo secures a less pleasant position as an Apprentice Park Gardener. He works the majority of the month. But eventually discovers that he\u2019s unable to continue working, as the apprenticeship exam is open only to American citizens.\nBy now Cornelius N. Bliss Jr.\u2019s small allowance has probably ceased. The little he\u2019s earned in May is disappearing. And he searches for some other kind of employment.\nIt\u2019s probably in May and June that he goes to the Waldorf-Astoria, one of the great New York hotels, to write on the their fine stationery to his mother (to reassure her that he\u2019s alright and is doing well). That he eventually revealed this to his family, is known, thanks to his older brother, Alberto, mentioning it in a lengthy interview in 1977.\nHe manages to secure a position as a Bank Teller. However, due to poor English, or an inability to calculate quickly enough, or both, he loses this job. And is once again forced to look for another vacancy.\nIt\u2019s now, in mid. June, that he catches the eye of \u2018Dickie\u2019 Warner \u2013 true name Richard H. Warner \u2013 a blonde, blue-eyed man in his late twenties, who\u2019s as much of a Social Moth as Schuyler L. Parsons Jr.. Apparently, Dickie sees him: \u201c\u2026 seated at the opposite side of the dancing space in company of several friends.\u201d After a formal introduction they converse. And days later he invites him to dinner on the roof of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. On that warm evening, they afterwards sit drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes, and Rodolfo opens his heart to the near stranger. Telling him he\u2019s a foreigner in a foreign land. Isn\u2019t getting anywhere in his profession. And is: \u201c\u2026 too proud to seek aid from his family.\u201d Dickie\u2019s sympathetic and tells Rudy he can move into his apartment with him until things improve. Which, the very next day, he does. Warner helping him to pack his possessions at his \u201canything but cheerful\u201d lodgings. Thus commences a quite lengthy and comfortable stay, at Dickie Warner\u2019s gorgeously decorated two room studio, at 78 West 55th Street. Rudy wakes late each day; lounges about in pyjamas in Warner\u2019s tulip wood bed; plays with the cat, Prunella; and talks on the telephone to his girlfriends. His host is irritated by his poor English but doesn\u2019t mind his singing. (The song that he sings most often is Mamma Mia.)\nWarner\u2019s detailed \u2013 too detailed to be fabricated \u2013 account, which was published in the early Twenties, in a piece entitled, Before They Were Famous, in SCREENLAND, reveals much about Rudy half way through 1914. He continues to frequent some of the places he enjoyed earlier that year as and when he can. Has friends. And is still able to dress and present himself well. Warner remembered: \u201c\u2026 distinctly, his dress suit, also the handiwork of a tailor in Taranto.\u201d This pretty much proves false, the claim that Frank A. Mennillo took him to his New York tailor, to kit him out in more suitable, American garb. He was in May and June still wearing all of the garments he\u2019d carried with him at the end of the previous year.\nSo far he\u2019s moved from Giolitos, to Uptown, then out to Long Island, then back to Manhattan. (He also appears to have been in Brooklyn at some point in order to be able to save money.) Living with Dickie facilitates indolence. For the time being, at least, he seems in no hurry to do anything, except laze, pet Prunella, and speak for hours on the telephone. According to his host a stay of a few days stretches to many weeks. In my estimation at least a month to six weeks.\nRudy continues to live with Dickie. At some point the pair enjoy a trip to Long Beach; for so long, that Warner is forced to wire a friend in the city, and get them to climb through a window, in order to feed the cat.\nAt the end of the month World War One breaks out in Europe. However, as neither Italy nor America are initially involved, it doesn\u2019t yet affect Rodolfo Guglielmi, or, his family.\nAfter six or so weeks his stay with Warner ends. Where he goes next isn\u2019t too clear. Yet it\u2019s certain about now is when things begin to get very tough. For the next eight weeks he goes from poorly-paid job to poorly-paid job. He washes dishes, cleans automobiles, and polishes brass; anything that will give him enough money to be able to eat and pay for a place to sleep.\nThis is a period where he\u2019ll move about even more frequently, staying a week here, then a week there. Always moving. He\u2019s forced to pawn his belongings. What\u2019s left is kept by a Landlady that he\u2019d been unable to pay. In later years, he told Norma Talmadge a story about walking five miles to City Hall, in order to find work, and, after failing to, how he\u2019d bought a \u201cbologna sandwich\u201d with his very last ten cents, before walking the five miles back. The fact Norma recalled such a story, in 1938, again shows he couldn\u2019t possibly have had a Godfather during this time.\nNineteen-year-old Rodolfo continues to suffer. He eats at one, perhaps all, of the Horn & Hardart Co. Automats, on Broadway, Sixth Avenue and West 42nd St. And he sleeps at the downbeat, Mills Hotel, which charges 12 cents per night. When he can\u2019t even afford that he doesn\u2019t eat and sleeps on a bench in Central Park. (He also sleeps under the shrubbery and in all-night cinemas.)\nThere\u2019s absolutely no evidence nineteen-year-old Rudolph Valentino was forced to commit any crime in order to survive; but we must consider the possibility he may have had no choice. It\u2019s interesting, that in a letter home, he feels that any work is better than a life of crime. And it\u2019s in this letter, according to the family, that he reveals he\u2019d come very close to compromising his honour. So if he didn\u2019t commit a crime it was certainly on his mind. The disappearance of the contents of his police file, decades ago, doesn\u2019t allow us to be sure one way or the other. In a report, in The New-York Tribune, in 1910, vagrants were only arrested if they were considered to be a \u2018Cadet\u2019 \u2014 in-other-words, a person learning to be a street criminal. If they were, they were discharged, sent to a work house, or, fined. If Rudy slept on a park bench, he would simply be moved along; as Anthony Dexter was, as Valentino, in Valentino (1951). (A rare instance of accuracy in an otherwise largely inaccurate film.)\nBroke and homeless things are so bleak that Rudy contemplates suicide. Then a Mystery Man he meets changes his luck. The person, apparently an Italian, takes him under his wing, shares his food and his bed, talks to him, gives him advice, and perhaps allows his guest to get a wash and to shave. The next day, or soon afterwards, after the suggestion, Rodolfo heads to Maxim\u2019s/Cafe Maxim to speak to the piano player (who\u2019s from Taranto). The piano player suggests talking to the Head Waiter there. When he does, The Head Waiter recalls him from earlier in the year, and offers him work as a dance partner for hire. (To dance with females who aren\u2019t already accompanied by a male.) He accepts and commences that month. There\u2019s no pay, but he can eat for free, keep any tips, and use an upper room, with a Victrola, to give dance instructions on the side.\nA different version of Rodolfo\u2019s spell as a dancer, at Cafe Maxim, is found in the owner, Julius Keller\u2019s, 1939 memoir, Inns and Outs. Keller claims that he himself hired him. And that Rudy had been washing cars at a nearby garage. Keller says that he found the young man to be \u201cdark and romantic in appearance\u201d. Whether it was Keller\u2019s or another proprietor\u2019s innovation isn\u2019t clear. But dance partners for hire were far from unique to Maxim\u2019s. They were very much looked down upon at the time as it was considered to be an unsuitable profession for a Real Man.\nMaxim\u2019s was, along with Sherry\u2019s, Delmonico\u2019s, Luchow\u2019s, Churchill\u2019s, Rectors, Murray\u2019s, and a few other venues, a restaurant that allowed patrons to dance. Their adverts in September declared that it was the \u201cCOOLEST and BEST VENTILATED DINING ROOM in TOWN\u201d. That luncheon was just 60c. That dancing was from noon to close. And the cabaret was after 6:30 p. m.\nDark, romantic Rodolfo Guglielmi swiftly enhances his natural ability, and is an instant success with patrons. He returns to being a Marchese; but, perhaps due to the French atmosphere of the establishment, tells customers he\u2019s a Marquis. By now he has many regular female dance partners. And these varied ladies generously tip him and shower him with small gifts.\nIn the third or fourth week of the month, Bonnie Glass (\u201cthe most original young person in the [dancing] profession\u201d), and her former dance partner, Clifton Webb, arrive at Cafe Maxim and take a table. Glass has asked Webb to assist her in searching for a talented new partner, and they soon notice: \u201c\u2026 a remarkably handsome, dark young man named Rudolph.\u201d Bonnie is impressed by his tango and, on the spot, offers him the job. He tells her frankly that he doesn\u2019t have the money to pay for the clothing required. And she tells him that she\u2019ll cover the cost.\nIn Clifton Webb\u2019s posthumously published autobiography, Sitting Pretty: the Life and Times of Clifton Webb, 2011, the then very notable Bonnie Glass had recently returned from Chicago. Checking her engagements in late 1914 I saw this to be the case. (She\u2019d danced in Chicago recently with Al. Davis.) And so I trust both Clifton Webb\u2019s memory and his story. It seems Bonnie had a partner \u2013 George Richmond \u2013 but he was temporary. And, as she had plans for 1915, that included re-opening the grille of Cafe Boulevard, at Broadway and 41st Street, as Cafe Montmartre, she required somebody reliable who\u2019d be available nightly. (For me this settles once and for all the question of how they met and came to be a successful Act.)\nIt\u2019s easy to imagine Rudy\u2019s delight in being singled out by Bonnie and Clifton after they\u2019d left and it all began to sink in. In no-time-at-all he would be able to quit the establishment and leave behind him, perhaps forever, the life of a Taxi Dancer \u2014 a life he found more than a little distasteful.\nDuring the first two weeks of the month Rodolfo rehearses with Bonnie in the mornings and continues to work as a hired dancer, at Maxim\u2019s, in the afternoons and evenings. He likewise continues to be the favourite of several ladies (as mentioned by Keller in Inns and Outs). And utilises the upper room, with the Victrola, to provide private instruction for a fee.\nMid. December, he dances for the first time with Glass, at Rector\u2019s, in front of their \u201cstage setting\u201d, for an elegant New York audience seated amidst \u201cfronded palms\u201d. He\u2019ll continue to do so for the rest of the month. And, though he fails to be credited at this point in any adverts, he\u2019s buoyed by the realisation that bigger things lie ahead of him in 1915. In only a matter of months he\u2019s turned his life completely around. This year, the Festive Period will not be the lonely, upsetting affair it was twelve months before.\nThank you so much for reading this post.

{"doc": {"text": "Some of us can recall the helpless feeling of being in a vehicle driven by someone who is intoxicated. If you're like me, you don't want to cause a scene unless the driving is really erratic. But there comes a moment when you need to say: Stop the car. You're going to hurt someone. Hand over the keys.\nWe have a political system that is the equivalent of a drunk driver. The primary culprits are the House Republicans. They are so intoxicated with their own ideology that they are ready to drive the nation's car off the road. I don't know if the sequestration that began Friday will produce a little crisis or a big one; the sad fact is that the Republicans don't know either, yet they're still willing to put the country at risk to make a political point.\nI'm no fan of the way President Obama has handled the fiscal crisis. As I've written often, he needs to provide the presidential leadership that leads Congress and the country toward fiscal stability. In my analogy, he should take the steering wheel firmly in hand and drive the car toward the destination where most road maps show we need to be heading \u2014 namely, a balanced program of cuts in Social Security and Medicare and modest increases in revenue.\nInstead, Obama has chosen to be co-dependent, as the psychologists say about those who foster the destructive behavior of others. He double-dared the reckless Republicans by proposing the sequester back in 2011. And rather than stepping up to leadership since his re-election, he has triple-dared the GOP hotheads with a partisan inaugural address and weeks of what the Republicans rightly have called a \"road show\" of blame-game politics. Doesn't he see that the GOP is addicted to this showdown at Thunder Road? This is all the power the GOP has these days, really \u2014 the ability to scare the heck out of everybody and run the car into the ditch.\nMuch as I would criticize Obama, it's wrong to say that both sides are equally to blame for what's about to hit us. This isn't a one-off case of the Republicans using Obama's sequestration legislation to force reckless budget cuts. It's a pattern of behavior: First the Republicans were prepared to shut down the government and damage the national credit rating with their showdown over the debt ceiling; then they were careening toward the \"fiscal cliff.\" This isn't a legislative tactic anymore, it's an addiction.\nWhere did this recklessness come from? Only a few years ago, George W. Bush was the compassionate conservative and John McCain won the GOP nomination as the Republican who knew how to govern across party lines. What happened to that Republican Party? Today's Republicans seem to suffer from what's sometimes known as Obama Derangement Syndrome, in which their hatred of the president blinds them to the country's interests. To be honest, this malady is eerily similar to the Bush Derangement Syndrome that afflicted Democrats during the previous decade. The Democrats were so incensed back then they stopped caring if America succeeded or failed in Iraq; the Republicans are so angry now that they don't care if the economy goes to hell.\nSo how can we get these incapacitated drivers to stop before they do any more damage? If this were really a case of chronic drinkers, the answer would be an intervention to keep them off the road. In politics, the public gets to intervene through elections. We just had one, and the Republicans lost, big time. Yet it didn't seem to make much difference. The House Republicans are still grabbing for the wheel and the car is rumbling toward trouble.\nObama tries everything to gain control \u2014 except a clear, firm presidential statement that speaks to everyone onboard, those who voted for him and those who didn't \u2014 that could get the country where it needs to go.\nThe weird thing is that, politics aside, there is every reason to be optimistic about America's future. The country's financial markets are resilient; the housing slump finally seems to be ending; a new era of low-cost shale oil and gas is beginning and, as a result, the U.S. is becoming a competitive manufacturing economy again.\nThere's one ruinously dysfunctional part of the American story, and that's the breakdown of our political system.

Before recording the song Springsteen said it was his goal to sing like Roy Orbison, with words like Bob Dylan's and a sound like Phil Spector's early-'60s productions.\nBOTH SIDES OF THE STORY (Phil Collins) (1993)\nSome of the lyrics were inspired by dialogue from the movie Grand Canyon (which starred Kevin Kline and Danny Glover).\nBRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER (Simon & Garfunkel) (1970)\nPaul Simon was inspired to write this ballad after hearing a gospel song by the Swan Silvertones who sang - \"I'll be your bridge over deep water if you trust my name.\"\nBROTHER LOVE'S TRAVELLING SALVATION SHOW (Neil Diamond) (1969)\nIt was originally titled Mo Getta Mo.

The comparable average for the category was significantly lower, at just 2.68.\nThis award is seen as particularly prestigious because votes are cast directly by specialised retailers in the industry.\nMichael Mayer, head of sales for Meiko warewashing equipment in Germany, Austria and Switzerland thanked GGKA for the award: \u201cWe\u2019re tremendously proud to have been ranked as a \u2018Super Partner\u2019, and particularly pleased that we took a premier position in the \u2018Large Equipment\u2019 category.

The winners were chosen by an expert jury and the readers of the trade journals \u2018Gastronomie & Hotellerie\u2019 and \u2018GV-kompakt\u2019.\nSustainability has made major inroads into the hospitality and food service sectors, with concepts such as energy efficiency, environmental stewardship and fair trade becoming firmly established in the market. To remain successful in a competitive market, restaurant and catering managers are now faced with the challenge of creating strategies and solutions which meet both business-focused and eco-friendly criteria. That requires partners from the supplier industry that share the same philosophy and the same determination to offer products that promote sustainable production and consumption patterns.\nNow MEIKO has yet another reason to celebrate. Having already received the sustainability award in 2012, MEIKO has done it again in 2016 in the Water category with its M-iQ GreenEye technology. Achieving reductions of up to 50 percent in fresh water and rinse agent, GreenEye is an innovation which optimises capacity utilisation to maximise savings. Using a smart system of indicator lights, it facilitates teamwork between the machine and its operators and ensures an efficient cleaning process.\nHaving already accepted the Super Partner award the evening before, Michael Mayer was delighted to receive yet another prestigious prize: \u201cMany thanks to all the readers of the \u2018GV-Kompakt\u2019 and \u2018Hotellerie & Gastronomie\u2019 trade magazines.

{"doc": {"text": "Yesterday, Variety ran a story detailing Netflix\u2019s roll out of patches, Netflix\u2019s version of gamification badges, that will further reward binge watching and passive behavior in children.\n\u201cWe are testing a new feature on select kids titles that introduces collectible items for a more interactive experience, adding an element of fun and providing kids something to talk about and share around the titles they love. We learn by testing and this feature may or may not become part of the Netflix experience.\u201d \u2013 Netflix\nBefore we jump into some data I wanted to briefly uncover the business side of this roll out. What Variety\u2019s story, among others, doesn\u2019t detail is that the first iteration of this service was likely tested in early 2016.\nI first noticed Netflix\u2019s gamification positioning while watching Kong: King of the Apes, a Netflix animated children\u2019s series, with my son. There were special one to two minute long episodes you could unlock called Kong: King of the Apes \u2013 Battles. In them you were able to view the lead character, Kong, fighting a previous episode\u2019s monster.\nAs you watched more episodes you would unlock a power up for that special battle episode. You would then have the option to select which way you would try to defeat the monster in a choose-your-own-adventure style interface. Your selection would trigger a new video and impact the outcome of the fight; you would win or lose based on that decision.\nIt shouldn\u2019t surprise you that Netflix tested this concept two years ago. It\u2019s common practice for larger businesses to roll out pilot programs and beta test ideas. Especially with a service like Netflix that deeply analyzes the behavioral impact of thumbnail image selection and viewership (this is an incredible deep dive into A/B testing for acceptance, by the way).\nThe episodes are unlocked when viewing the series sequentially so it seems to be less about watching episode six to unlock the battle, but more about creating a momentary break in the standard cadence of viewing. When done strategically, these breaks reset a viewers brain to give the impression they\u2019ve watched less than they actually have watched. This unlocking also triggers a brief release of dopamine to feel like they\u2019re accomplishing a task that is highly rewarding to them.\nWhat happens when we reward passive behavior like binge watching?\nChildren learn through gamifying their education at an early age. It\u2019s a very simple system that provides a path to a reward. When the path is complete the child feels like they\u2019ve accomplished something. Peak-a-boo results in a happy family member which then reinforces the positive emotional response in the child. Saying their first word results in an emotional response from a parent. Riding their bike for the first time. Reading. Participating in class. Helping others. All form an emotional response in their brain releasing dopamine that locks in that experience.\nThat\u2019s the positive side of gamification. What about the negative?\nLet\u2019s use a slot machine as an example. Slot machines are created to trigger visual and aural feedback in the gambler. Those feedback elements trigger dopamine and reinforce your engagement in the machine. What many people don\u2019t think about is that the slot machine\u2019s reaction to you winning $0.05 and $5,000 are exactly the same. That\u2019s what pulls you in and makes you feel like you\u2019re winning even if your winnings are less than the cost of that play.\nCasinos have even removed the need to physically pull down the slot machine lever reducing the friction to gamble. Reducing the friction reduces the effort involved to play and, conveniently, reduces the amount of time it takes to spend money. See how that works? Note: This is also why Amazon is so successful, but we will cover that in another post.\nWhere does Netflix\u2019s patch gamification framework fit into this?\nChildren between the ages of two and eighteen are spending an average of twenty five days a year streaming or 1.8 hours a day \u00b2.\nBusiness Insider teamed up with CordCutting.com to put that into perspective. They compared that data against data from the National Wildlife Federation, which stated that children spend an average of four to seven minutes playing outdoors per day \u00b3.\nKeep in mind that this is prior to Netflix\u2019s gamification efforts.\nIf Netflix is now rewarding the behavior of children binge watching content with added episodes, power ups, or other restricted content otherwise not available it incentivises them to watch even more content.\nAgain, this is no different than earning grades, stars, stickers, or other forms of rewards for children. That is integrated into our day to day lives on various levels. However, the difference here is that we place a reward on passive behavior. Behavior that requires little effort on their part and results in little-to-no personal growth, creation, or experience. It\u2019s temporary.\nThe kids are alright, right?\nNetflix is seeing rapidly growing engagement in their children programming. Andy Yeatman, Netflix\u2019s director of kids and family content shared that the kids and family section usage has climbed 13% in the United States, but an even larger 61% in other markets4.\nNetflix is a business and their primary goal is to generate revenue. In 2017 alone Netflix generated over 11 billion in revenue5. Due to their lack of ad revenue from broadcasting television commercials, which saves children from 150 hours of commercials a year6, they need to sell memberships.\nWhile it\u2019s up to the parents to pay for Netflix, data shows that children are gaining access to mobile devices at an earlier age. Not just to devices, but to their own service plans.\nIn a Nielsen report from 2017 they stated that about 45% of children in the United States between 10 and 12 have their own smartphone with their own service plan as opposed to using wi-fi7. A separate report by Common Sense Media found that 42% of children 8 and younger have their own tablets8.\nIn the same way behavior that may be counter productive, or harmful, for adults (see gambling reference above) is mostly governed by our own limitations (money, time, employment, health, etc), children\u2019s viewing habits should be structured in a way that makes sense for each family.\nIt is not Netflix\u2019s role to make the decision to limit viewing time for children. They simply see growth potential and position themselves to capitalize on that opportunity.\n1 \u201cSo Netflix achivecements and unlockables now\u201c, NeoGaf.

It\u2019s common practice for larger businesses to roll out pilot programs and beta test ideas.

When done strategically, these breaks reset a viewers brain to give the impression they\u2019ve watched less than they actually have watched. This unlocking also triggers a brief release of dopamine to feel like they\u2019re accomplishing a task that is highly rewarding to them.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "What happens when we reward passive behavior like binge watching?", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Children learn through gamifying their education at an early age. It\u2019s a very simple system that provides a path to a reward. When the path is complete the child feels like they\u2019ve accomplished something. Peak-a-boo results in a happy family member which then reinforces the positive emotional response in the child. Saying their first word results in an emotional response from a parent. Riding their bike for the first time. Reading. Participating in class. Helping others.

What about the negative?", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Let\u2019s use a slot machine as an example. Slot machines are created to trigger visual and aural feedback in the gambler. Those feedback elements trigger dopamine and reinforce your engagement in the machine. What many people don\u2019t think about is that the slot machine\u2019s reaction to you winning $0.05 and $5,000 are exactly the same.

{"doc": {"text": "A few weeks ago, The Economist reported on an academic study in America that uncovers what would seem to be blindingly obvious to everyone with even a passive interest in politics \u2013 that corporates and the rich get their desired policies implemented much more than the average person on the street.\nWhat really piqued my attention however was not the \u2018no shit Sherlock\u2019 nature of the study, but the chiding comment at the end of the article about \u2018populism\u2019.\nApparently populism is a threat, and specifically The Economist notes, a threat to the financial sector and the economy. Long-time readers of the Economist such as myself must note this frequent assertion in much of its coverage.\n\u2018Pop-ulism\u2019: Implementing the policies that the average person on the street would like.\nOne can only surmise that the Economist thinks populism is negative, as opposed to say the current situation where presidential candidates must parade before lunatic billionaires in Las Vegas for money as if they were part of some kind of Lovely Girls competition. The stance is darkly amusing I must say \u2013 Yes, the real problem with our democracies has been that our politicians have actually been listening too much to the people!\nFundamentally the discussion about the merits of populism goes to something so much deeper about history and politics than what the Economist ever ventures.\nThere are those that see populism and implementing the will of the people as the defining characteristic of human progress over the past 300 years.\nAnd then there are those that make arguments for why populism is a \u2018bad\u2019 thing.\nBasically they boil down to:\n- \u201cMob rule\u201d and in particular to imposition of the majority\u2019s will on the minority.\n- The ignorance/stupidity of the average man on the street: If the polling in one of the world\u2019s leading democracies is anything to go by, are citizens capable of being entrusted with serious policy questions?\n- That the people cannot be trusted to make clear headed long term decisions which may involve some deal of short term pain.\nDo these arguments stack up? The second argument about ignorance makes the assumption that there is someone out there who \u2018knows better\u2019 and deserves to be in charge. While the third argument is nowadays usually used by some people in the context of proposing to make massive cuts in pensions/healthcare/education, whilst usually these same people also asking for quid pro quo tax cuts.\nThe first argument is the one we should all really be paying attention to though. Its the most direct argument based on class interest you will ever hear from a conservative in a public setting: What\u2019s good for everyone isn\u2019t necessarily what\u2019s good for me.\nSo you can see why these are the main justifications elites use to take power from the people and hand it to \u2018technocratic\u2019 bodies like central banks, supranational bodies like the EU Commission or judicial/arbitration bodies like the courts. The slow transfer of power from institutions capable of implementing populism like democratically elected government to these outfits has been a hallmark of the later 20th century.\nThe most ostentatious act in this tale is modern day Thailand where anti-democratic forces have such constituency among the establishment that their supporters openly call for rule by arbitration and want to banish democracy altogether. Thailand may not exactly strike most readers as a particularly liberal place but at least commentators don\u2019t fall back on the lazy neo-colonial canard that it just simply \u201cisn\u2019t ready for democracy\u201d.\nThailand is basically an acid test \u2013 where a commentator or media outlet stands on this issue tells you all you need to know about their politics as I\u2019m about to explain.\nWithout being too churlish, Thailand is the natural end game to those that hate populism.\nWhat I\u2019m going to propose here is something that goes to the bottom of my political philosophy\u2026democracy is an inherently left wing political system of organisation.\nIts literally giving power to the people. To the average man on the street.\nAnd that\u2019s why conservative elites that sit on the American supreme court, or in the European Commission\u2019s chambers or on the streets of Bangkok hate it. They can\u2019t stand giving power to the people directly because it would leave open the possibility that the people would one day wake up from their brainwashing and exploitation and vote for something in their interest.\nWhy do you think the Supreme Court in America would like to equate money with speech?\nAnswer: To amplify the economic power of conservative elites to influence the outcomes of elections.\nWhy does the EU centralise most of it actual power in the most undemocratic body of its structure \u2013 the EU Commission?\nAnswer: Because the European elites that set it up and perpetuate it know that ramming down a neo-liberal agenda through democratically elected institutions like the Council and Parliament would go nowhere due to popular resistance.\nWhy do Yellow Shirt Protesters want to hand power to an unelected People\u2019s Council?\nI think you get the idea.\nSince the French Revolution, the advent of a historical movement to hand more power to the people that we now recognise as \u2018democracy\u2019 has coincided with a direct decline of influence of conservative elites (in those days the monarchs, aristocrats, and the church etc.). Therefore there has always been a fundamental antagonism between democracy as a concept and conservatism. People forget where we get the terms \u2018left wing\u2019 and \u2018right wing\u2019 is not from political talk-shows but the physical position of those that sat in the Estates General supporting or opposing democracy following the revolution.\nAs the Enlightenment wore on of course, and as further time went by conservatives developed novel strategies for managing this fundamental antagonism between their class interest and those of the average man on the street.\nThe first was simply to crush populism with brute force. But this failed because this divided the classes into clear battle lines and merely hastened class conciousness in the \u2018average man\u2019.\nConservatives then turned to stoking the fires of nationalism and distracting the \u2018average man\u2019 from demanding political change at home and focusing on an \u2018enemy\u2019 abroad. Unfortunately for them wars couldn\u2019t possibly go on long enough to distract people. Even the unique Orwellian solution by American conservative elites to promote a \u2018Cold War\u2019 that could put the country in a constant state of nationalistic right wing fever faced an ignominious end with the Vietnam War as the American public lost faith in the enterprise.\nWhich brings us back to the solution that we see from conservatives today \u2013 to stealthily transfer power to unelected bodies and institutions whilst maintaining control of such things in the shadows.\nEventually this strategy too will fail.\nYou can\u2019t fool all of the people all of the time.\nSo don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 conservatives would rather not act in the shadows. In fact its a symptom of their diminution that they must do so in the Western world. If our beloved conservative elites thought they could get away with imposing their will by brute force and eliminating democracy like they do in Latin America, the Middle East or Asia, they would not hesitate.\nLet us therefore treasure our democracies fellow populists. Wherever you may be. As long as conservatives even have to pay lip service to them, we have some power. But someday the conservatives will run out of ideas and again resort to brute force as in Thailand, and when they do I hope you dear reader will be on the right side of history.", "id": "<urn:uuid:2a53cdb5-ec32-4b61-bf5a-f592b96fa4ef>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2018-34", "url": "https://icarusgreen.wordpress.com/2014/07/07/populists-of-the-world-unite/", "date": "2018-08-22T01:21:29Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2018-34/segments/1534221219242.93/warc/CC-MAIN-20180822010128-20180822030128-00360.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9541898369789124, "token_count": 1573}, "content": [{"line": "A few weeks ago, The Economist reported on an academic study in America that uncovers what would seem to be blindingly obvious to everyone with even a passive interest in politics \u2013 that corporates and the rich get their desired policies implemented much more than the average person on the street.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "What really piqued my attention however was not the \u2018no shit Sherlock\u2019 nature of the study, but the chiding comment at the end of the article about \u2018populism\u2019.", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Apparently populism is a threat, and specifically The Economist notes, a threat to the financial sector and the economy.

{"doc": {"text": "I recently saw this woman's blog who decided that she be intentional about taking photos of her with her children. She didn't want them to look back at photos when they were grown and not see her with them. With that in mind I am going to try and take photos of Stomper and I together, even if they aren't amazing. I am going to try at least once a month to join her in \"Embrace the Camera\".\nTuesday night you were up from 9pm-1130pm fussing and crying. Papa tried snuggling with you in bed, but you didn't lay still. At 10 o'clock I took you downstairs to read for twenty minutes because you were so worked up. You snuggled with me in bed for about an hour before I laid you down in your own bed.

{"doc": {"text": "In February 2005, I got an email from Lisa from the Elearning Network of Australasia (ElNet). It was a voluntary organization that she set up with her agency business partner to progress the Elearning industry mainly in Australia. I was working in the Government, building elearning courses including some cool projects with Lisa\u2019s agency.\nLisa wanted to know if I was happy to present at the ElNet conference she was planning for later in the year. I was scared shitless of the idea but I knew that wasn\u2019t a good enough reason to say no. So I agreed.\nThe conference wasn\u2019t until November so I had the best part of a year to plan (worry) about the event. And that\u2019s exactly what I did.\nI would think about it most days and wonder how I was going to do it. I worked for months on a flash-based presentation full of animation and examples of courses we had worked on. Whenever I would think about it I\u2019d feel physically sick at the thought of speaking in front of a group. Every time I got an email from Lisa about a project, any time I saw anything from ElNet, most days really, I\u2019d get that sinking reminder of what I was going to have to do. I imagined myself standing in front of hundreds of people and talking. I really had no idea how that was going to work. I struggled just standing in front of one person talking.\nI can\u2019t tell you how many times I thought about it and worried about it that year.\nOn the day of the event I planned to fly down in the morning of my session which was scheduled for 10am. I was also pretty scared of travelling, in particular flying in planes so I wanted to get it out of the way quick.\nI was all organized, had my laptop and my flashy presentation, even donned a suit. I got to the airport and made an interesting discovery. I\u2019d screwed up my times and I was an hour late. My flight had already left!\nI managed to get on the next flight but by this time I was so panicked and stressed I didn\u2019t even know if I\u2019d be able to present at the event. It was overcast as well so I was extra nervous about flying. As the plane was taking off my palms were sweating so much I had to keep wiping them on my pants. I thought I was going to die, but then I came to my senses and calmed down. You have to focus on the positives. \u201cYes you might die\u201d, I thought \u201cbut at least then you won\u2019t have to do the presentation!\u201d.\nIt was at that point when I heard a massive bang and the whole plane shook. We had just been struck by lightning.\nI freaked the fuck out. I had no idea what was going to happen except of course I knew I was going to die. The pilot came over the PA system all casual and said yeah that happens sometimes, it\u2019s all good.\nWell I did present at that conference (more on that later), but it would be my last conference presentation for 9 years.\nEventually I decided to get back into speaking. The first event was WordCamp Sydney at the end of 2014, the day before I launched The 7 Day Startup. In the 8 months or so since, I\u2019ve spoken in Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sydney, Melbourne, Bangkok & Cebu in venues ranging from 50 to 400 people including conferences like the $4,000 / head Tropical Think Tank in the Philippines, The 700 person strong Problogger and the Brisbane and Melbourne Digital Marketing Summit.\nThe impact I\u2019ve made with speaking has been very surprising to me, here is a sample of some of the tweets.Dan's Speaking\nBut the biggest thing for me is yesterday\u2019s Digital Summit in Melbourne, was the first event I\u2019ve presented where I haven\u2019t been nervous.\nHere are the 8 things that helped me go from certainty of death, to zero nerves and ultimately get over my fear of public speaking. If you are nervous about public speaking, I recommend you do the following.\n1. Understand the power of public speaking\nAt the end of 2014 I decided to have another crack at public speaking. It had been 9 years since my first attempt. In that time I\u2019d only attended 2 or 3 conferences, and the idea of speaking at one scared me more than I can tell you. But I decided that it was a better option than being a pussy, so I agreed to speak at WordCamp.\nI attended the first day of the event, walked around not knowing anyone and worried myself sick about what the next day would be like. I thought very seriously about flying home and pretending I was never there. No one knew me, no one talked to me, I was too scared to talk to anyone else, the organizers probably didn\u2019t even know I was there.\nBut I did turn up on day 2 and spoke to a small group of around 60-80 people.\nI remember it being a hell of a lot easier than I imagined. I just went up the front, and talked for 30 minutes. People loved it, I wasn\u2019t that nervous and it went well.\nIt was the day The 7 Day Startup was uploaded to Amazon. I know that because someone in the audience searched for it and found it and told me in front of everyone during the Q&A session at the end of my talk. It was supposed to go live the next day.\nBut it was what happened afterwards that had a lasting impact. I had a few people come up to me afterwards who wanted to chat and thank me for my talk. Since then I\u2019ve learned that this is standard when you speak at conferences. At the time I was blown away, but it was one lady in particular who taught me a big lesson.\nShe came up to me and said something like \u201cThankyou so much for this talk, you have truly changed my life\u201d. She didn\u2019t stick around to talk, she just walked off. I had written 700 blog posts in the 5 years prior trying to spread my message, and never once had anyone ever said anything like that to me.\nFrom that day forward, every time I have spoken, to help me battle my nerves I\u2019ve thought about that moment and said to myself \u201cYou might actually change someone\u2019s life today\u201d. I probably sound like a wanker saying that but if you are nervous about public speaking, it helps to know that it\u2019s not all about you. You might truly reach people in ways you otherwise can\u2019t, and when it\u2019s about other people and not you, well you just have to get it done.\n2. Recognize the autopilot factor\nWhen I was speaking at WordCamp something weird happened. I was about 10 minutes into my presentation and I sort of felt like I was watching myself from afar. I just had a moment where I was like \u201cHoly shit I\u2019m speaking\u201d. That was weird enough but what was weirder is I noticed something. I wasn\u2019t actually nervous. It had been about 10 minutes, I hadn\u2019t really thought about nerves and I hadn\u2019t really thought about anything. I was on auto pilot.\nI\u2019ve heard the same thing from a lot of other public speakers. For the time they are on stage, they kind of black out, and go into auto pilot mode.\nI think this is even the case with experienced presenters. They become someone else when they are on stage and before they know it, their session is over and they barely remember it. I spoke with Matthew Kimberley about this (more on Matthew below) who said this \u201cI go into a heightened sense of being. I become a better, more engaging and more interesting version of myself, feed off energy in the room and get amped up. An entire gig can go by super fast. I might forget sections of it. I think that\u2019s adrenaline\u201d.\nI guess my point is, if you aren\u2019t going to remember it anyway, and you aren\u2019t even going to realize you are doing it, then why worry about it?\n3. Have a calm anchor\nWhen I was in the Philippines speaking at the Tropical Think Tank event, I had a lot of great chats with my mate James Schramko. In one conversation he mentioned the idea of having anchors. This is my recollection of it. I might have completely misunderstood the concept but it works for me. He held his wrist with his thumb and finger and said \u201cthis is an example of an anchor, when I do this I feel calm\u201d.\nThis sounded like a good idea, and I definitely need to feel calm so I started doing it. I have a bracelet thingy (above) that I got as a present at that event and every time I need to feel calm, I hold that and close my eyes for a second and think back to the event.\nA few weeks later at a Duane Alley training course (more on that later), I learned a bit more about these anchors. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m convinced that there is some sort of gesture that behaves as an \u2018anchor\u2019 that magically makes you calm. But I do know that I\u2019ve gotten in the habit of holding my bracelet when I need to, and it makes me stop, breath and that alone calms me down.\nSo in summary. Do it \ud83d\ude42\n4. Realize that you probably enjoy it\nI mentioned above when I presented at WordCamp, I went into a kind of autopilot mode. The other weird realization I had at that time was I specifically remember thinking \u201cI\u2019m actually enjoying this!\u201d.\nI liked the feeling of speaking to a bunch of people who were intently listening to me. For all the stress I had been through working up to it and worrying about how bad it would be, it was crazy to think that maybe I could actually enjoy doing this?\nI love creating content and sharing what I\u2019m doing. So why is it so crazy that I would like doing that in person from the stage?\nI think the reality is that most people probably would enjoy speaking in front of a decent size group of people. If you took nerves out of the equation, most people wouldn\u2019t mind 30 minutes of attention. 30 minutes where you can talk about what you love and be looked up to as an expert.\nThe thing you fear so much might actually be something you like, which is kind of crazy right?\n5. Make your content 100% original\nEvery time I\u2019ve spoken at an event I\u2019ve inevitably made the mistake of comparing myself to other speakers. There was no worse example than this than Tropical Think Tank in 2015. I was the 3rd speaker of day 1. It was a $4,000 event and I had to follow John Dumas and Matthew Kimberley. There were giant signs around the room with my face on it!\nJohn is an incredibly outgoing and engaging speaker with an amazing story. I knew his stuff well and has been following him for years, but I was still blown away by his moving and inspirational talk.\nI\u2019d met Matthew the night before. He was an amazingly funny and charismatic person. But that humor and charisma at the bar was nothing compared to Matthew on stage. The guy was a serious pro! Insanely funny, polished, dramatic and just plain fucking awesome to be honest.\nFollowing these guys was not easy but I had to keep telling myself that no matter how good other people were, they couldn\u2019t tell my story. My content is 100% original. My story is uniquely mine. I\u2019ve worked hard on my content and my message to make sure that when someone hears it, I can at least guarantee that they won\u2019t have heard it before and they won\u2019t hear it again. I tell myself this when I get nervous about not being as good as other presenters.\nIf you are a new presenter, with your own story and unique content then you have a big advantage, so keep telling yourself that.\n6. Realize that speaking is easier than attending\nI think the biggest shift in getting over my fear of public speaking was the simple realization that I wasn\u2019t that scared of it after all. I\u2019ve always been nervous with in person networking and socializing generally. I find it pretty challenging and I worry a lot about what people think and whether I will be accepted.\nFor this reason I attended very few events before I started speaking at them. I probably attended 2-3 events over almost a decade of entrepreneurship and the idea of actually speaking at an event seemed insane.\nBut what I realized once I spoke at a few events is, it\u2019s actually a LOT better to attend an event as a speaker than as a participant. I could go into 1,000 reasons why that is the case but for me the main one was just the fact that I could avoid the awkward situations trying to approach people to make small talk and just have other people approach me. It\u2019s very easy to talk to people who come up and ask specific questions after you talk (and it will happen). And when you speak, you enter into this weird zone where everyone thinks you are a lot more important than they would otherwise think.\nWhen I speak at events now I like to hang out with the participants and just be my normal self before I talk. I always get a kick out of it because then after I speak the people will come up and treat you like royalty. It\u2019s crazy. More than once I\u2019ve had people come up to me and apologize for not realizing that I was \u2018a speaker\u2019. Seriously!\nBecause people put you on the pedestal when you speak, attending events is actually a lot easier as a speaker than an attendee.\n7. Learn how to do it well\nNothing builds confidence like competence. When I decided to start speaking at the end of 2014, I decided I wanted to do it well. My own style of learning how to do things well is to throw myself in the deep end and lock in a bunch of presentations.\nThat was great and the ongoing presentations have resulted in a lot of improvements. But I also decided to learn the skills of public speaking. I invested in a Power Presenter Training course with Duane Alley in July this year. It was a 3-day, in-person course that covered everything from tonality, movement, content structure, slides, selling from stage, NLP, Inductions you name it. It was a real eye opener to say the least! I found the training very challenging and confronting but it blew my mind wide open in terms of how to really present well.\nOnce I did that training, I never looked at public speaking in the same way again. I learned a few things that I have put into practice. But the biggest thing I\u2019ve learned is an appreciation for how complex it is, and how much there is to know. It really blew my mind open seeing how someone like Duane works and when I went back to events that I was speaking at, I noticed all sorts of things in myself and other speakers that I otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had a clue about.\nAnd it made me more confident. I realized that most people who speak at events, don\u2019t go to the trouble of doing this. the more competent I became with my skills, the more confident I got about presenting.\nI\u2019ve got so far to go with speaking that I even hesitate to use the word competent, but you would never know how far you have to go if you don\u2019t take the time to look at how the pros do it.\n\u201cNothing builds confidence like competence\u201d. How to get over fear of public speaking. CLICK TO TWEET THIS.\n8. Remember what you are worried about won\u2019t happen\nVirtually every time I\u2019ve presented, I\u2019ve worked up a worst case scenario in my head about what will happen. The slides won\u2019t work. No one will turn up. I will trip over. I will forget my talk. I will stumble over my words. People won\u2019t laugh. People will laugh. I will freak out and not be able to do it. I will probably wee or shit myself.\nAt the recent Problogger Conference on the Gold Coast, Jadah Selner from Simple Green Smoothies presented as the first keynote speaker. For the rest of the day all I heard was \u201cJadah is amazing\u201d. I agreed. Jadah was definitely amazing! The problem was my talk the following day was at the same time as Jadah\u2019s second talk. And what\u2019s more, there was another talk on a similar topic to mine by Christina Butcher and Carly Jacobs, who were also amazing! I was kind of bummed actually cause I wanted to go to both those talks!\nI worked myself into a frenzy worrying that no one would turn up to my talk. Every time I heard \u201cJadah is amazing\u201d on that first day (which was a lot), I nodded and agreed but I freaked out inside because I knew no one would come to my talk. That night I couldn\u2019t sleep and I dreamt I was walking past a big wooden box full of tigers. It was 3.9m high and I knew that Tigers could jump a lot higher than that. I thought when I walked past, the tigers would jump out and maul me.\nIt was kinda weird, but scary cause in dreamland you don\u2019t worry about whether things are realistic.\nAs it turned out, in my dream the tigers didn\u2019t jump out. They just stayed there.\nMy talk at Problogger was the best one I\u2019ve done. I had a full room of 200 people, the same number that attended both other talks.\nI should have known, because I\u2019d learned this lesson 9 years earlier.\nRemember that ElNet conference I freaked out about for a year beforehand and I almost died getting to? For that year I couldn\u2019t possibly imagine myself presenting to hundreds of people, how would that even happen? Well I walked into the event and there were 20 people there, dressed casually sitting around a table. I didn\u2019t even have to stand up for my presentation! I ran through my slides like I was having a meeting at work, like I did every other day. It went well. 20 minutes later it was done.\nSo why does it suck?\nAfter I spoke at that ElNet conference I felt an enormous sense of relief and satisfaction. It wasn\u2019t quite the Tony Robbins style keynote I\u2019d manufactured in my brain but still, I had spoken at a conference! I was pumped!\nI got the same feeling at WordCamp 9 years later, the immense relief and the afterglow of presenting was amazing. The same thing happened when I spoke at Superfast Business Live in Sydney, Tropical Think Tank in the Philippines, DCBKK in Bangkok, Social Media Day on the Gold Coast, The Digital Summit in Brisbane and Problogger on the Gold Coast.\nYesterday when I spoke at the Digital Summit, I wasn\u2019t nervous. But I did my talk, then I left to go to another meeting and felt nothing. It went well, I enjoyed it, it was well received but it was business as usual.

{"doc": {"text": "Dr. J. Morgan Wells (1940-2017)\nDr. Morgan Wells, a pioneer in the diving world and founding director of the NOAA Diving Program, passed away on July 28, 2017. He will be remembered fondly by his colleagues at NOAA and in the diving community.\nDr. Wells was best known for developing the NOAA Nitrox I (32% O2/N2) and II (36% O2/N2) mixtures and their respective decompression tables in the late 1970s. Thanks to his research and testing efforts, these mixtures are now widely used in the scientific and recreational diving communities. He later developed NOAA Trimix I, a mixture of oxygen, helium, and nitrogen used in deep diving. Aside from his breakthroughs in breathing gas mixtures, he was also known for conducting research in undersea habitats, where people, known as aquanauts, can live for extended periods of time. Dr. Wells has been credited with having spent more time living on the ocean floor as an aquanaut, and having lived in more habitats than any diver on the planet.\nAlthough Dr. Wells was employed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) from 1972 until his retirement in 1995 and produced some of his most significant discoveries and accomplishments while working at NOAA, his love for diving and passion for the physics and mechanics of diving were evident very early in his life. He began diving at the age of 14, after making his own surface-supplied diving system out of a paint sprayer and a motor-scooter engine. A year later, Wells built an oxygen rebreather from surplus aircraft respirator parts by looking at diagrams in the U.S. Navy Diving Manual. He used that unit for several years to dive in the ocean, rivers, lakes and under the ice. By 17, he was writing letters to the Navy to alert them of technical errors in the Navy Diving Manual. When compressed air became available in his area, he switched to open circuit air diving and earned money teaching SCUBA diving while in college.\nHe received scientific diving training at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (University of California) in 1962 while receiving his Ph.D. in physiology. In 1965 he was accepted as a U.S. Navy Sealab Aquanaut for their \u201cMan in the Sea\u201d project and later received mixed gas and rebreather training at the US Navy Mine Defense Lab in Panama City, Florida. Later that year, he served as a Sealab II Aquanaut during a 15-day, 205 foot helium/oxygen saturation dive, beginning a 30-year career in undersea habitat diving. In addition to Sealab, he also dove inside TEKTITE, EDALHAB, HYDROLAB, PRINUL, HELGOLAND (Germany), and LORA (Canadian, under ice). Dr. Wells also served as operations director for special missions of HYDROLAB and HELGOLAND (in U.S. waters).\nDr. Wells began working at NOAA soon after NOAA was established in 1970. Starting in 1971, NOAA Diving was overseen by the Manned Undersea Science and Technology Office, where Dr. Wells served as science coordinator from 1972 until 1975. His duties included coordinating and conducting undersea research with scientists from around the globe. In 1975 he was appointed NOAA Diving Coordinator, where he was responsible for all aspects of NOAA\u2019s diving training, safety, and effectiveness.\nWhen the NOAA Diving Program was created in 1978, he was appointed director, maintaining his duties as NOAA Diving Coordinator and assuming the administrative duties of the Director. In 1989 Dr. Wells achieved his career-long ambition of creating the NOAA Experimental Diving Unit (EDU). He happily left the Washington, DC area for the new NOAA EDU, which was housed at the U.S. Army Diving Detachment at Fort Eustis, VA.\nDr. Wells\u2019 early research interests were centered on the respiration of marine organisms as related to temperature and oxygen concentration. He used undersea habitats and diving frequently for studies of symbiotic systems of algae and invertebrates (corals, giant clams, sea anemones). His Ph.D. dissertation research was on the effects of pressure on human hemoglobin oxygen binding properties. He then studied the effects of elevated nitrogen pressure on the oxygen binding properties of hemoglobin of humans and deep diving seals, which eventually led him to the development of Nitrox and Trimix breathing mixtures that benefited all divers.\nDr. Wells\u2019 most recent work (1995-1996) was related to gas separation technology and low energy consumption life support systems for long term undersea habitation.\nDr. Wells was also responsible for starting the diving medical curriculum at NOAA, having organized and taught (for 20 years) a Diver Medical Technician (DMT) course. In the late 1970s he also designed a training program with the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS) for physicians in diving and hyperbaric medicine. The NOAA/UHMS Physicians Training in Diving Medicine is the only course of its kind taught in the United States and is the most widely respected civilian program of its nature in the country to this day.\nEver active, he continued to teach a class in the Physicians Training in Diving Medicine course alongside other respected medical professionals in the field, lecturing on undersea habitats and nitrogen breathing mixtures. He taught his last class for the NOAA/UHMS course on October of 2016.\nHis many contributions and his ever inquiring mind will continue to inspire and benefit the progress of diving physiology, the pursuit of scientific research underwater, and the diving community at large.", "id": "<urn:uuid:6e288852-885f-412b-ab34-3d51cb55c7a6>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2022-21", "url": "https://www.omao.noaa.gov/find/media/articles/2017-08-03/dr-j-morgan-wells-1940-2017?qt-qt_global_images=0", "date": "2022-05-26T08:49:51Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2022-21/segments/1652662604495.84/warc/CC-MAIN-20220526065603-20220526095603-00200.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9726154804229736, "token_count": 1181}, "content": [{"line": "Dr. J.

{"doc": {"text": "BP oil spill animals affected\nFederal wildlife officials reported that 1, 144 ocean turtles, 609 which had been dead, and 109 marine mammals (mostly dolphins, the majority of which had already died) were gathered on or near the coast. Many of these animals were visibly oiled, however may have died of other causes. In the case of sea turtles, researchers genuinely believe that a number of the fatalities might be owing to drowning in shrimp trawls in angry dash that occurred in expectation of fisheries closures as a result of spill. Whatever the cause, the turtles were rendered more in danger of the oil spill effects. Wildlife rescuers collected significantly more than 8, 000 birds; tragically, about 6, 000 among these wild birds had already died if they had been collected. Other people were rehabilitated but might not have ultimately survived the traumatic experience. Many more wild birds were oiled because of the crude polluting coastal marshes.\nMany species of seafood, seabirds, marine mammals and water turtles have already been impacted from oil spill. Obtaining the stranded creatures shows only a portion associated with the oil spill\u2019s casualties. It might be years until the real consequences of oil spill on wildlife tend to be grasped. Through the oil spill, about one-third for the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s waters were shut to fishing. Some fisheries remain shut, and concerns stay about meals security.\nWithin height of this oil spill, Atlantic bluefin tuna, a critically imperiled species whoever numbers have now been decimated by overfishing, had been spawning inside gulf coast of florida. This location \u2014 specially the area suffering from the spill \u2014 comprises the sole known spawning reasons the western population of Atlantic bluefin tuna. The oil proved poisonous to eggs, which float near the surface, also to younger fish concealing in drifting sargassum seaweed, which might have gathered oil and increased the fish\u2019s exposure. May 24, 2010, the guts petitioned the us government to guard Atlantic bluefin tuna underneath the Endangered Species Act, pointing aside the few person tuna that made it after dark gauntlet of longlines returning to their Gulf spawning reasons had been then threatened by oil and poisonous dispersants. Experts estimate that the oil spill killed a lot more than 20 % of juvenile western Atlantic bluefin tuna this season \u2014 and therefore estimation does not look at the anticipated long-term unwanted effects associated with oil spill within the tuna\u2019s reproduction habitat.\nJeopardized sperm whales were spotted moving through giant slick. Blue, fin and sei whales in addition swim through these oceans. As air-breathing mammals, whales taking a trip through the area had no option but to surface amid the oily sheen for air. Breathing toxic fumes can damage mucous membranes and airways. In extreme situations, it could also trigger demise. Furthermore, specialists predicted that plankton that baleen whales like blue whales and fin whales count on would endure significant declines from the air pollution.\nAnother species in the base of the system, the menhaden, might also feel the impacts of the spill. Along with encouraging a fishery harvesting on average one or more billion weight per year, the menhaden is a vital meals source for sharks, tuna, swordfish and marine animals. It\u2019s a particular specialty of fish-eating wild birds like herons, gannets, gulls, osprey and brown pelicans. As with a number of other species, the oil spill hit during the middle associated with menhaden\u2019s spawning season.\nThe sea-grass beds south regarding the Chandeleur Islands and elsewhere across the coast provide food, protection and nursery websites for a multitude of marine life, including many fish and shark types. Sea-grass beds provide crucial habitat for West Indian manatees that nibble on the sea lawn and boost their particular young within these superficial, peaceful waters. Oil can smother sea grass, robbing these mild giants of their meals resource. Additionally, oil can get into manatees\u2019 eyes and physical hairs on the noses once they surface to breathe, causing irritation and disease that impair the pets\u2019 ability to breed and give.\nKemp\u2019s ridley sea turtles forage and nest along the Louisiana coastline. Breton Sound plus the Chandeleur Islands, the very first coastal places to-be struck with BP\u2019s oil, tend to be specially crucial places for this species. Ironically, the turtle\u2019s success in crawling toward recovery may have place it at an increased risk due to enhanced amounts of juveniles coming to nearshore oceans during the spill to forage on blue crabs, many of which were contaminated by poisonous oil. Adult females also passed through the area on their way to nesting beaches along the coasts of Texas and Mexico during the height of the spill.\nOil make a difference sea turtles in many different techniques. Ingestion of oil through contaminated food and absorption through direct physical contact can cause damage to the turtle\u2019s intestinal tract as well as other organs. Oil may also cause irritation of mucous membranes when you look at the eyes, nose, and throat, that could trigger infection. Eggs laid in oil-contaminated sand \u2014 or by an oil-contaminated mom \u2014 cannot develop properly, while newly hatched turtles may become oiled while crossing a contaminated beach. Hopes continue to be that attempts to move sea turtle eggs were successful, and that the turtles will survive their migrations and come back to nest one day.\nAnother species whose success story was turned on its head may be the brown pelican. Delisted during 2009, the brown pelican was one of the most prominent sufferers of oiling, reduced habitat and loss of food supply.\nCOASTAL WETLANDS AND BEACHES\nOil coating seaside marshes as well as other wetlands contaminated sediments, poisoned wildlife and smothered salt-marsh grasses as well as other wetland plant life.

{"doc": {"text": "This page in brief\nHow do people get to be christians? Do many convert by their own choice, or do most just get born into christian families or christian countries? And what does this say about whether people have good reasons to be christians?\nI couldn\u2019t find good answers to these questions, so I decided to do some research and analyse the data myself. The answers were interesting, and maybe a little surprising \u2013 about a third to a half of present day christians are converts.\nSceptics and converts\nCritics of christianity sometimes argue that most christians believe without good reason. This argument is partly based on the \u201cfact\u201d that most people in the world follow the religion of the country they were born into. Therefore, the argument goes, if they were born elsewhere they would believe differently, thus demonstrating that most people\u2019s faith is based on geography rather than good reasons, and few people convert because they are convinced of the truth of christianity.\nTesting the argument\nThe argument raises a challenging point, although it seems to fall short as an argument:\n- Believing in the religion one was brought up in doesn\u2019t make that religion wrong \u2013 or right.\n- If a religion grows, as christianity has grown, it must, as a matter of sheer mathematics, start out by making converts. But as it becomes larger, the number of people born into the faith must inevitably increase.\n- Christianity is in decline in most of the traditionally christian countries of the west (mainly Europe and North America), but is growing fast in generally non-christian countries in Asia and Africa. This suggests christianity finds it easier to make converts than to retain those born into a christian heritage.\nBut what are the numbers?\nIf you can\u2019t find it, do it yourself\nI couldn\u2019t find the information I needed online (only one source came close, but as noted below, the information was problematic). So I decided to gather the best information I could find and develop a population model in a spreadsheet. I am not a demographer, but I am familiar with spreadsheet models. A more detailed description of what I did is below.\nHow many christian converts?\nThe spreadsheet modelled christian and non-christian populations in the west (Europe and North America) and the rest of the world, and was calibrated to conform to known data. It produced the following results.\nUsing data on the number of those who self-identified as christians, the model suggested about 30% of christians living today were converts and about 70% were born into nominally christian families or culture.\nI also wanted to see if the result changed if only those who were \u201cactive\u201d christians were considered (approximately identified as those who attended church regularly). On this basis, about half of christians living today were converts and half were born into christian families.\nThis model and the history of christianity\nChristianity began in the Middle East, and grew by making converts. Within a few centuries there were more christians in Europe than anywhere else. By 1900, christianity had become entrenched in christian culture in Europe, but it was beginning to lose numbers. So the graph shows that there were then relatively few converts in Europe and North America, and most christians were born into the faith.\nBut the twentieth century also saw the beginning of a massive growth in christianity in Africa and Asia (and a change in the style of christianity in South America). So the number of conversions began to rise again. This growth continues to this day, but inevitably will eventually lead to more people being born into christian families, and the number of converts will probably begun to drop as a proportion.\nClearly many christians (about 30-50%, depending on how \u201cchristians\u201d are defined) living today are converts from a \u201cnon-christian\u201d background. They clearly had some reason to change faiths.\nMore about the model (for those interested)\nIt is very hard to find reliable and consistent information about population and religious belief. Here are my sources:\n- World population by Pew Forum, Wikipedia, DSS Research, Vaughn\u2019s, Geohive, Worldometers, University of Botswana, ADMC and Facts & Details.\n- Christian numbers by Questia, Pew Forum, Douglas Jacobsen and Why Church\n- Birth, death, conversion and deconversion rates, by World Bank, The Guardian, Pew Forum, Tom Smith and Wikipedia.\n- Church attendance by Church Leaders, Hadaway, Marler & Chaves, Adherents.comClaude Fischer, PBS, Wikipedia, Nationmaster andFranck & Iannaccone.\n1. The model uses 10-year periods from 1900 to 2013. Calculations were done for the west (Europe and North America) and the rest of the world, and then summed to give the global figures.\n2. In each period, the data for the previous period was used to calculate the numbers of births and deaths (for the whole community and just for christians), plus conversions to christianity and \u2018deconversions\u2019 from christianity. These allowed the values for total population, christian converts, christians by birth and non-christians tro be calculated for the end of the decade.\n3. The birth and death rates were adjusted as necessary to allow the known populations to be reproduced by the model. This then determined the births and deaths within the christian community.\n4. Then the estimated conversion and deconversion rates were adjusted to accurately reproduce the estimated christian populations.\n5.

I really like the color, especially for tops because it is a calm and flattering color for my complexion. I found this Rebecca Minkoff top at Finicky Filly on King Street. Finicky currently is rolling in delicate spring options. I also tried this one in white, and I was smitten with the structure! A few weeks back I found this killer skirt from Sam\u2019s Closet on Wentworth. It is so easy and the layered look is on trend right now. THE SHOES! I am loving these babies. I am still breaking them in however, and I am covered in Hello Kitty bandaids. Fashion is pain. Shoes on King, is my favorite shoe spot. Truly. It really is. If you are down for quality shoes, I highly recommend it. These heels are Jeffrey Campbell and they are pretty ballin. Everyone has been loving them. Once again with a touch of the 70s feel and a modern twist. (I currently have not found them online, but I am working on it!) The clutch is really a wallet, and found at Aldo. I loved the colors and I was looking for something easy. My phone did fall out of it though and I had to get a new screen, so there\u2019s that. Aside from that mishap I was happy with the way it looked but I don\u2019t think I will use it to function as a clutch again. The look was completed with my Karen Walker sunnies and Theodosia jewels that I pulled for the night!", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Gwynn\u2019s of Mount Pleasant- luxe and bombshell models", "label": "advertising language", "split": false}, {"line": "Rock the Runway Model Competition\u2013 precious pretty faces and long legs", "label": "advertising language", "split": false}, {"line": "Emerging Designer: Workman Velasco by Daniel Velasco and Ryan Workman", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Emerging Designer: Crespo by Casey Crespo", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Emerging Designer: Whittington Design by Sydney Smith", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Emerging Designer: Sara Ellis Clark by Sara Ellis Clark", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Emerging Designer: Roy Blake Smith by Roy Blake Smith", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Featured Designer: Todd Snyder New York", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Toni of Sunflowers and Lace", "label": "clean", "split": false}, {"line": "Pictures: By roommate and I via my petite Canon", "label": "clean", "split": false}]}
